1
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:18,350
<i> Tell me about your morning.</i>

2
00:00:20,653 --> 00:00:22,755
Start from the beginning.

3
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:27,626
I woke up.

4
00:00:27,628 --> 00:00:29,728
How did you sleep?

5
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,565
I didn't. I don't.

6
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,035
You just said you woke up.

7
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,570
I stopped lying down.

8
00:00:40,407 --> 00:00:41,740
<i> Alone?</i>

9
00:00:46,846 --> 00:00:48,414
Of course, alone.

10
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:51,784
I meant Rosie. Your daughter.

11
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,219
Uh, she's with friends.

12
00:00:54,454 --> 00:00:55,721
Why?

13
00:00:56,623 --> 00:00:58,857
Can't always cope.

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,295
And last night wasn't good.

15
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,098
It's understandable.

16
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,234
Is it, why?
Why is it understandable?

17
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:11,203
Why does everything have to be
understandable?

18
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:17,409
Why can't some things be unacceptable?
And we can just say that.

19
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:20,045
I only mean it's okay.

20
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:24,083
I'm letting my daughter down.
How the hell is that okay?

21
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,484
You just lost your wife.

22
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:28,554
And Rosie just
lost her mother.

23
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:37,296
<i> You are holding yourself</i>
<i> to an unreasonable standard.</i>

24
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:40,299
<i> No, I'm failing to.</i>

25
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:45,671
So, there is no one you
talk to? Confide in?

26
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,072
No one.

27
00:01:47,074 --> 00:01:50,242
Oh, I'm picking up Rosie
this afternoon.

28
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,677
After I see my therapist.

29
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:54,179
Got a new one.
I'm seeing her today.

30
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:56,715
Are you gonna
tell her about me?

31
00:01:57,484 --> 00:01:58,784
No.

32
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,786
Why not?

33
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:01,787
-'Cause I can't.
-Why not?

34
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:04,223
Because I can't, you know I can't.
She thinks you're dead.

35
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:08,060
John, you've got to remember, 
it's important.

36
00:02:09,028 --> 00:02:10,462
I am dead.

37
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:15,234
Please. For your own sake
and for Rosie's.

38
00:02:15,236 --> 00:02:17,636
This isn't real. I'm dead.

39
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,005
-John, look at me.
-Mmm.

40
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:24,443
I'm not here.
You know that, don't you?

41
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:28,313
Okay. I'll see you later.

42
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:32,417
<i> Is there anything</i>
<i> you're not telling me?</i>

43
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,123
No.

44
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,628
What are you looking at?

45
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:43,662
Nothing.

46
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:45,797
You keep glancing to my left.

47
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:49,368
Oh, I suppose I was
just looking away.

48
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:54,173
There is a difference between
looking away and looking to.

49
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:57,442
-I tend to notice these things.
-I'm sure.

50
00:02:57,444 --> 00:03:01,246
Now, I am reminding you
of your friend, I think.

51
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,183
That's not necessarily
a good thing.

52
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:07,052
Do you talk to Sherlock Holmes?

53
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:07,719
I haven't seen him.

54
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:11,790
No one's seen him. He's locked himself away 
in his flat. God knows what he's up to.

55
00:03:11,792 --> 00:03:12,624
Do you blame him?

56
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,027
I don't blame him...
I don't think about him.

57
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,996
Has he attempted to
make contact with you?

58
00:03:17,998 --> 00:03:18,397
No!

59
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,465
How can you be sure?
He might have tried.

60
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:22,267
No, if Sherlock Holmes
wants to get in touch,

61
00:03:22,269 --> 00:03:25,304
that's not something you
can fail to notice.

62
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,093
Well, now.

63
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:50,162
Won't you introduce me?

64
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:42,014
<i> Hello. Thank you, thank you.</i>

65
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:47,653
Hello.

66
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:53,458
Mr Smith, whenever you're ready.

67
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,629
Now, please.

68
00:04:57,631 --> 00:04:59,398
Bring them through.

69
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:11,243
It's difficult having such
good friends.

70
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:15,414
Friends are people
you want to share with.

71
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:20,018
Friends and family.

72
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:25,590
What's the very worst
thing you can do...

73
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,393
To your very best friends?

74
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,332
Something on your mind?

75
00:05:33,766 --> 00:05:37,269
Yes, Simon. Oh yes.

76
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:43,241
Whatever you tell us, stays in this room.
I think I speak for everyone.

77
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:49,614
Well, what is the worst
thing you could do?

78
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,318
Tell them your darkest secret.

79
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,253
Because,

80
00:05:55,255 --> 00:06:00,692
if you tell them, and they decide
they rather not know...

81
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,494
You can't take it back.

82
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:05,764
You can't unsay it.

83
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,234
Once you've opened your heart,

84
00:06:09,236 --> 00:06:12,270
you can't close it again.

85
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:21,012
I'm kidding.

86
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,016
Of course, you can.

87
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:28,487
Well, everyone, please,
roll up your right sleeves.

88
00:06:28,489 --> 00:06:32,023
Roll up your right sleeves.
Come on.

89
00:06:32,425 --> 00:06:36,061
Oh, it's a bit of insurance.

90
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:38,463
I don't understand.
What is that?

91
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,266
Td 12.

92
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:44,035
-One of ours.
-One of yours?

93
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,238
We make it, my company. Td 12.

94
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,544
Sells mainly to dentists and hospitals, 
for minor surgical procedures.

95
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,746
Interferes with...

96
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,283
-The memory.
-The memory.

97
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,418
Yes.

98
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:04,423
I want to thank you, Ivan,
for allowing me to use it.

99
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:07,726
Didn't exactly know who
you were gonna be using it on.

100
00:07:08,395 --> 00:07:11,596
-You mean you didn't ask.
-Is everyone ready?

101
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:13,098
-No.
-Please.

102
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,535
Roll up your sleeves.
Come on, roll up.

103
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,209
This is obscene.

104
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,677
All I'm doing, Faith dear...

105
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:30,348
...is getting something
off my chest.

106
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,684
Without getting it on yours.

107
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:37,489
What you're about to hear 
me say may horrify you. But...

108
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:38,990
You will forget it.

109
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:42,127
If you think about it,
civilisation has always

110
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,997
depended on a measure
of elective ignorance.

111
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:57,542
These drip feeds will keep the drug in 
your blood streams at exactly the right levels.

112
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:59,110
Nothing that is
happening to you now

113
00:07:59,112 --> 00:08:03,114
will stay with you for more
than a few minutes.

114
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,417
I'm afraid that some of the

115
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:10,555
memories you've had up to 
this point might also be...

116
00:08:13,526 --> 00:08:15,460
...Corrupted.

117
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,563
I'm going to share
something with you now.

118
00:08:18,565 --> 00:08:21,666
Something personal.

119
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:24,002
And of importance to me.

120
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,506
I have a need to confess.

121
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:31,643
But you, I think,
might have a need to forget.

122
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:36,147
By the end of this, you'll be
free to go, and don't worry,

123
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:39,751
by the time you're back
in the outside world

124
00:08:39,753 --> 00:08:42,220
you will not remember any
of what you've heard.

125
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:45,724
-Ignorance is bliss.
-What's wrong with bliss?

126
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:51,096
Some of you know each other
and some of you don't.

127
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,500
Please, be aware
that one of you

128
00:08:55,502 --> 00:08:58,670
is a high ranking
police officer.

129
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,174
One of you is a
member of the judiciary.

130
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:11,283
One of you sits on the board
of a prominent broadcaster.

131
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:18,356
Two of you work for me.
And one of you of course, is my lovely daughter.

132
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,158
Faith.

133
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,528
You are the people
I need to hear me.

134
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:30,302
I have made millions, for myself 
for the people around this table,

135
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:33,338
for millions of people
I've never even met.

136
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,177
There are charities that I support 
who wouldn't exist without me.

137
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:43,148
If life is a balance sheet,
and I think it is,

138
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,484
well, I believe I'm in credit!

139
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:51,790
But I have a situation.

140
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:55,694
That needs to be managed.

141
00:09:55,696 --> 00:10:02,133
I have a problem and there is 
only one way that I can solve it.

142
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,338
And what's that?

143
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,744
I'm terribly sorry.

144
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,418
I need to kill someone.

145
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,090
Who?

146
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:36,434
<i> Were we in a meeting?</i>
<i> Was there a meeting?</i>

147
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:43,808
Need to kill someone. Faith.

148
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,678
<i> My dear, dear girl.</i>

149
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,579
<i> I can't remember.</i>

150
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:51,249
<i> I can't remember who</i>
<i> you're gonna kill.</i>

151
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,285
<i> In five minutes,</i>

152
00:10:54,287 --> 00:10:58,156
<i> you won't even remember</i>
<i> why you were crying.</i>

153
00:10:59,258 --> 00:11:00,325
<i> The others are all fine.</i>

154
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:02,727
<i> You know,</i>
<i> they've gone down the pub.</i>

155
00:11:02,729 --> 00:11:05,397
<i> It's all on me.</i>

156
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,070
<i> Oh Faith. Don't you think</i>
<i> I should take that?</i>

157
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,673
<i> It's only going to upset you.</i>

158
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:23,248
Three years ago, my father told me
he wanted to kill someone.

159
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,116
One word, mr Holmes,

160
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,552
and it changed
my world forever.

161
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,288
Just one word.

162
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,723
What word?

163
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,293
-A name.
-What name?

164
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,632
I can't remember.

165
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:44,269
I can't remember who
my father wanted to kill.

166
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:46,304
And I don't know
if he ever did it.

167
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:50,475
You've changed, you need to top up 
your tan and your roots are showing,

168
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:51,443
you're letting yourself go.

169
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:55,246
Do you ever look in the mirror
and want to see someone else?

170
00:11:55,248 --> 00:11:56,815
No. Do you own
an American car?

171
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:58,149
-I'm sorry?
-No, not American.

172
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:00,185
Left hand drive.
That's what I mean.

173
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:02,220
No. Why do you ask?

174
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,157
Not sure actually. 
Probably just noticed something.

175
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:14,799
Are you okay?

176
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:18,536
Of course, you don't own a car. You don't need one.
Do you? Living in isolation.

177
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:20,338
No human contact. No visitors.

178
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,740
Okay, how do you know that?

179
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:22,741
It's all here, isn't it? Look.

180
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,442
Cost cutting is clearly
a priority for you

181
00:12:24,444 --> 00:12:26,111
look at the size of your
kitchen, teeny-tiny.

182
00:12:26,113 --> 00:12:28,813
Must be a bit annoying when
you're such a keen cook.

183
00:12:28,815 --> 00:12:29,647
I don't understand.

184
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,716
Hang on a minute. I was looking out 
of the window. Why was I doing that?

185
00:12:31,718 --> 00:12:34,753
-I don't know.
-Me neither. Must've had a reason.

186
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:35,687
It'll come back to me.

187
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:39,090
Presumably, you downsized
when you left your job.

188
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:42,794
And maybe when
you ended your relationship.

189
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:44,662
-You can't know that.
-Of course I can.

190
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:47,832
There wasn't anything physical
going on, was there?

191
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:50,535
Quite some time, in fact.

192
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:51,469
There, see, it's obvious.

193
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,404
You can't tell things like
that from a piece of paper.

194
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,841
- Think I just did, didn't I?
- I'm sure that was me.

195
00:12:56,843 --> 00:12:58,610
-How?
-Dunno.

196
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:00,678
Sort of happens.

197
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,382
Like a reflex,
I can't stop it.

198
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:13,658
Coat.

199
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,496
-I don't have a coat.
-Yes, well I just noticed, I wonder why.

200
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:23,034
- Are you talking to her?
- Piss off!

201
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:24,769
-So, what do you think?
-Of what?

202
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:27,138
-My case.
-Oh, it's way too weird for me.

203
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,408
Go to the police. They're really 
excellent at dealing with this...

204
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,744
Complicated sort of stuff.
Tell them I sent you.

205
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:36,014
That ought to get a reaction.
Night-night.

206
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,532
Please. I have no one
else to turn to.

207
00:13:54,534 --> 00:13:58,736
Yes, but I'm very busy at the moment.
I have to drink a cup of tea.

208
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,541
This cup of tea...

209
00:14:03,543 --> 00:14:04,609
-Code?
-It's a cup of tea.

210
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:09,380
Because you might
prefer some coffee.

211
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:12,050
You're my last hope.

212
00:14:12,052 --> 00:14:16,087
Really, that's bad luck, isn't it?
Good night. Go away.

213
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:18,156
What's bad luck?

214
00:14:18,158 --> 00:14:21,392
Stop talking. It makes me
aware of your existence.

215
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:22,794
I've always had bad luck.

216
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:24,596
-It's congenital...
-Handbag.

217
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:28,399
That's not rude. Congenital.
It just means...

218
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,201
Handbag.

219
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,569
Stop! Wait!

220
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:35,607
Your life is not your own.
Keep your hands off it. Do you hear me?

221
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,309
Off it. Off it!

222
00:14:38,311 --> 00:14:40,178
Sorry. What?

223
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,346
What are you talking about?

224
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:42,747
-Your skirt.
-My skirt?

225
00:14:42,749 --> 00:14:45,316
Look at the hem of it!
That's what I noticed. Sorry.

226
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:48,720
I'm still catching up with
my brain. It's terribly fast.

227
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,054
Those markings,
do you see them?

228
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,624
You only get marks like that by 
trapping the hem of your skirt

229
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:54,225
in a car door, but they're on
the left hand side,

230
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:56,761
so you weren't driving. 
You were in the passenger seat.

231
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:57,562
I came in a taxi.

232
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,397
There is no taxi waiting
in the street outside.

233
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:02,467
That's what I checked when
i went to the window.

234
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,601
And you've got
all the way to the door

235
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,637
and not made any move to phone 
for one, and look at you.

236
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,306
You didn't even bring
a coat, in this rain?

237
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,475
Now, that might mean
nothing, except

238
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:13,278
the angle of the scars
on your left forearm,

239
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,280
you know, under that sleeve
you keep pulling down.

240
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:19,784
-You never saw them.
-No, I didn't. So thank you for confirming my hypothesis.

241
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:23,021
I don't really need to check
that the angles are consistent

242
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:24,122
with self-harm, do I?

243
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,624
-No.
-Then you can keep your scars.

244
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,127
I want to see your handbag.

245
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,595
Why?

246
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:31,296
It's too heavy.

247
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:34,465
You said I was your last hope,
and now you're going out into the night

248
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:38,169
with no plan on
how you're getting home.

249
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,604
And a gun.

250
00:15:46,211 --> 00:15:47,211
-Chips.
-Chips?

251
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:49,580
You're suicidal.
You're allowed chips.

252
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:53,284
Trust me.
It's about the only perk.

253
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,124
Sherlock!

254
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:00,758
Are you going out?

255
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,494
I think I remember the way.
It's through there, isn't it.

256
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:06,030
Oh, you're in a state!
Look at you!

257
00:16:06,032 --> 00:16:08,967
Yeah, well, I've got
a friend with me, so...

258
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:11,436
-What friend?
-Bye.

259
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:14,639
Oh.

260
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:18,476
Come on.

261
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:23,748
<i> I'm culverton Smith,</i>
<i> and this election year, I'll be voting...</i>

262
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:26,417
For god's sake, I was talking
to the prime minister.

263
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:30,388
I'm sorry mr Holmes.
It's your brother.

264
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:32,357
He's left his flat.

265
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,258
Was it on fire?

266
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:39,697
<i> Even when I'm on the road</i>
<i> I still like quality food.</i>

267
00:16:42,801 --> 00:16:44,602
You see the fold in the middle?

268
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:47,572
For the first few months,
you kept this hidden.

269
00:16:47,574 --> 00:16:48,706
Folded inside a book.

270
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,308
Must have been a tightly
packed shelf,

271
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,076
going by the severity
of the crease.

272
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,245
So, obviously you were keeping
it hidden from someone

273
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,447
living in the same house,
at the level of intimacy

274
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,117
where privacy could not be assumed.

275
00:16:59,119 --> 00:17:00,084
Conclusion? Relationship.

276
00:17:00,086 --> 00:17:03,588
Not any more, though.
There's a pin prick at the top of the paper.

277
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:06,624
The past few months,
it's been on open display on a wall.

278
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:07,992
Conclusion?
Relationship is over.

279
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:11,162
The paper has been exposed to steam 
and a variety of cooking smells.

280
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:15,166
So, it must have been
on display in the kitchen.

281
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:20,138
Lots of different spices.
You're suicidal, alone and strapped for cash.

282
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,672
Yet, you're still cooking
to impress.

283
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:26,677
You're keen, and kitchen is the 
most public room in any house.

284
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:30,982
And since any visitor could be expected 
to ask about a note like this,

285
00:17:30,984 --> 00:17:34,185
I have to assume
you don't have any.

286
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,387
You've isolated yourself.

287
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,757
-Amazing.
-I know.

288
00:17:41,326 --> 00:17:42,527
I meant the chips.

289
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:48,766
Hmm.

290
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:57,108
Let's go for a walk.

291
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,584
You should answer it.

292
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,252
It's Mycroft.

293
00:18:08,554 --> 00:18:09,320
Might be about Sherlock.

294
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,422
Of course it's about Sherlock.
Everything's about Sherlock.

295
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,391
<i> How did you know</i>
<i> my kitchen was tiny?</i>

296
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:15,226
The fading pattern
on the paper. It's not much,

297
00:18:15,228 --> 00:18:19,197
but it's enough to know your 
kitchen window faces east. Now.

298
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,232
Kitchen notice boards.

299
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,370
By instinct, we place them at eye level,
where there's natural light.

300
00:18:26,372 --> 00:18:29,407
Now look. The sun's only struck
the bottom two-thirds,

301
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:36,747
but the line is straight. So, that means 
we know paper is facing the window.

302
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,285
But, because the top section
is unaffected,

303
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:45,756
we know the sunlight can only be 
entering the room at a steep angle.

304
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:49,227
If the sunlight
was able to penetrate the room

305
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:51,229
when the sun
was lower in the sky,

306
00:18:51,231 --> 00:18:54,098
then the paper
would be equally faded.

307
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,366
Top to bottom, but no.

308
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:56,801
It only makes it when the sun
is at its zenith.

309
00:18:56,803 --> 00:19:03,741
So, I'm betting that you live in
a narrow street, on the ground floor.

310
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,612
Now, if steeply angled
sunlight manages to hit

311
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,447
eye level on the wall
opposite the window,

312
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:13,117
then what do we know
about the room?

313
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,757
The room's small.

314
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:24,996
-Oh, big brother is watching you.
-Literally.

315
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,466
We can keep tabs.
You didn't have to come in.

316
00:19:28,468 --> 00:19:31,302
I was talking to
the prime minister.

317
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,104
Oh, I see.

318
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,072
What's he doing?

319
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:37,675
Why is he just wandering
about like a fool?

320
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,243
She died, Mycroft.

321
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,345
He's probably still in shock.

322
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,046
Everybody dies.

323
00:19:42,048 --> 00:19:45,449
That's the one thing human beings
can be relied upon to do.

324
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,252
How can it still come
as a surprise to people?

325
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,754
You sound cross.

326
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:52,790
Am I going to be taken
away by security again?

327
00:19:52,792 --> 00:19:56,093
I have, I think,
apologised extensively.

328
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,195
You haven't made it up to me.

329
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,130
And how am I supposed to do that?

330
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:01,098
-Sex.
-I'm sorry.

331
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,402
Sex. How did you know

332
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:05,469
I wasn't getting any?

333
00:20:05,471 --> 00:20:09,407
It's all about the blood.
This one comes from the very first night.

334
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,541
You can see the pen marks over it.

335
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:15,079
I think you discovered the pains stimulated 
your memory so you tried it again later.

336
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:18,316
I'm no expert, but I assume that 
since your lover failed to notice

337
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:20,751
an increasing number of scars
over a period of months,

338
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:24,055
that the relationship
was no longer intimate.

339
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,389
How do you know
he didn't notice?

340
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:28,359
Oh, well, 'cause he would
have done something about it.

341
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:31,229
-Would he?
-Wouldn't he? Isn't that what you people do?

342
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,064
-Well that's interesting.
-What is?

343
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,432
-The way you think.
-Superbly.

344
00:20:34,434 --> 00:20:37,835
-Sweetly.
-I'm not sweet. I'm just high.

345
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:38,502
This way.

346
00:20:38,504 --> 00:20:41,772
-But we just came that way.
-I know, it's a plan.

347
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,374
What plan?

348
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,643
What is it? What now?

349
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:49,347
Sorry, um, traced
his route to the map...

350
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:56,854
Is he with someone?

351
00:20:56,856 --> 00:20:59,156
Not sure.
We keep losing visual.

352
00:20:59,158 --> 00:21:01,325
Mostly, we're tracking his phone.

353
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,060
<i> Don't call us. We'll call...</i>

354
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:05,363
I'm trying to sleep. Can you
stop ringing my damn phone?

355
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:08,199
<i> Sherlock has left his flat.</i>
<i> First time in a week.</i>

356
00:21:08,201 --> 00:21:10,234
-So I'm having him tracked.
<i> -Nice.</i>

357
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,669
That's very touching
how you can hijack

358
00:21:11,671 --> 00:21:15,539
the machinery of the state 
to look after your own family.

359
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,407
Can I go to sleep now?

360
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,676
Sherlock gone rogue is a 
legitimate security concern.

361
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:21,679
The fact that I'm his brother
changes absolutely nothing.

362
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:25,449
It didn't the last time,
and I assure you it won't...

363
00:21:28,687 --> 00:21:30,288
With Sherlock.

364
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:31,722
Sorry, what?

365
00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:35,293
Please phone me if he
gets in contact. Thank you.

366
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,797
Do you still speak to Sherrinford?

367
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:43,634
-I get regular updates.
-And?

368
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,370
Sherrinford is secure.

369
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,440
-Are we gonna walk all night?
-Possibly.

370
00:21:49,741 --> 00:21:51,475
It's a long word.

371
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:53,544
-What is?
-Bollocks.

372
00:21:56,848 --> 00:22:02,053
Culverton Smith, all this charity work.
What's in it for you?

373
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:06,123
We must be careful
not to burn our Bridges.

374
00:22:07,526 --> 00:22:09,460
Do you know why
I'm gonna take your case?

375
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:12,229
Because of the one
impossible thing you said.

376
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:13,531
What impossible thing?

377
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:17,134
You said your life
turned on one word.

378
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:17,535
Yes.

379
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:20,805
The name of the person
my father wanted to kill.

380
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:21,772
That's the impossible thing.

381
00:22:21,774 --> 00:22:23,474
-Just that right there.
-What's impossible?

382
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:27,178
Names are not one word.
They're always at least two.

383
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,113
Sherlock Holmes. Faith Smith.

384
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,481
Santa Claus.
Winston Churchill.

385
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:34,518
Napoleon Bonaparte. Actually,
just Napoleon would do.

386
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,186
Or Elvis?

387
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:37,188
Look, I think we can rule
both of them out as targets.

388
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:41,659
Okay, I got it wrong then.
It wasn't on one word. It can't have been.

389
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,394
Did you remember quite distinctly

390
00:22:43,396 --> 00:22:44,695
that your whole life
turned on one word?

391
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:48,199
So, that happened, I don't doubt it, 
but how can that word be a name?

392
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:52,103
A name you instantly recognise
that tore your world apart.

393
00:22:52,105 --> 00:22:53,337
Okay, well, how?

394
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:55,306
No idea yet.

395
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:59,143
But I don't work for free.

396
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,012
You take cash?

397
00:23:02,014 --> 00:23:04,148
Not cash, no.

398
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:24,301
Taking your own life.

399
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:27,471
Interesting expression.
Taking it from who?

400
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:31,642
Once it's over,
it's not you who'll miss it.

401
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:39,150
You know, death, it's something 
that happens to everybody else.

402
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:43,387
Your life is not your own.
Keep your hands off it.

403
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:49,727
You're not what I expected, you're...

404
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,332
-What? What am I?
-Nicer.

405
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,302
-Than who?
-Anyone.

406
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,481
Sorry, I...

407
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,686
Faith? Faith!

408
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:29,667
<i> You said your life</i>
<i> turned on one word.</i>

409
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:30,634
<i> A name can't be one word.</i>

410
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:36,707
<i> If you were to come round asking after him,</i> 
<i> that he'd rather have anyone but you.</i>

411
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:37,708
<i> Anyone.</i>

412
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:41,612
<i> -You're not what I expected.</i>
<i> -What? What am I?</i>

413
00:24:41,614 --> 00:24:44,081
<i> -Nicer.</i>
<i> -Than who?</i>

414
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:44,782
<i> Anyone.</i>

415
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,551
<i> Don't think anyone else is going to</i>
<i> save him, because there isn't anyone.</i>

416
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:52,590
<i> Anyone, anyone,</i>
<i> anyone, anyone, anyone</i> .

417
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:57,661
<i> I have a situation.</i>
<i> Needs to be managed.</i>

418
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:04,301
<i> There's only one way</i>
<i> that I can solve it.</i>

419
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,570
<i> And what's that?</i>

420
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,709
<i> I need to kill someone.</i>

421
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,377
<i> Who?</i>

422
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:14,712
Who?

423
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,315
Anyone.

424
00:25:19,284 --> 00:25:20,451
Of course.

425
00:25:20,453 --> 00:25:25,256
He doesn't want to kill one person.
He wants to kill anyone.

426
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:27,758
He's a serial killer.

427
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,759
Anyone.

428
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:31,729
-It could be...
-Anyone.

429
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,731
Why not?

430
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:36,567
Why shouldn't he be?

431
00:25:40,706 --> 00:25:43,674
-What is wrong?
-What's the matter with you?

432
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,244
Do you know where you are?
Are you drunk?

433
00:25:47,246 --> 00:25:49,747
-Shezzer.
-What are you doing here?

434
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:52,349
What were you doing in the
middle of a bloody street?

435
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:56,787
-You should be at Baker street.
-I am. So are you.

436
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,993
They found your address.
They brought you here.

437
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,765
You've had too much.
And that's me saying it.

438
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,968
<i> Kill.</i>

439
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:16,607
<i> Sherlock...</i>

440
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,781
<i> -Anyone.</i>
<i> -Anyone.</i>

441
00:26:23,783 --> 00:26:28,185
They're always poor,
and lonely, and strange.

442
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:32,389
-But those are only the ones we catch.
-Who do we catch?

443
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:34,024
Serial killers.

444
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:39,163
But if you are rich,
and powerful, and necessary...

445
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,798
<i> Anyone.</i>

446
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:46,570
What if you had the compulsion 
to kill and money? What then?

447
00:27:34,085 --> 00:27:35,686
Well now.

448
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,055
Won't you introduce me?

449
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:44,194
Ah!

450
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:47,531
Right, you there!
Stop right where you are!

451
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:48,766
-Oh, John.
-Mrs Hudson.

452
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:51,235
Do you have any idea what
speed you were going at?

453
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,404
Of course, not.
I was on the phone.

454
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:56,273
-Oh, it's for you, by the way.
-For me?

455
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,107
It's the government.

456
00:27:57,109 --> 00:27:58,709
-The what? What's going on? What's wrong?
-Hello?

457
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:03,247
<i> My name is Mycroft Holmes.</i>
<i> I'm speaking from the cabinet.</i>

458
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:06,450
-What's happened?
-It's Sherlock.

459
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:09,720
You've no idea
what I've been through.

460
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,494
I'm out of here. He's lost it.

461
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:19,563
He's totally gone!

462
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:24,435
"Once more unto the breach
dear friends, once more!"

463
00:28:24,437 --> 00:28:27,438
"Or close the wall up
with our English dead

464
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:31,675
set the teeth and stretch the
nostril wide. Hold hard the breath

465
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:33,577
and build up every spirit
to his full height on!"

466
00:28:33,579 --> 00:28:38,649
"On, you noblest English whose blood 
is fet from fathers, from war-proof!"

467
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:43,587
"And you, good yeoman, whose limbs 
were made in England, show us

468
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:44,722
here the mettle of your pasture!"

469
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:48,325
"I doubt not, for there is none 
of you here so mean and base

470
00:28:48,327 --> 00:28:50,394
that hath not noble
luster in your eyes!"

471
00:28:50,396 --> 00:28:56,233
"I see you standing like greyhounds 
in the slips straining upon the start!"

472
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,974
"The game's afoot."

473
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,444
Oh, hello.

474
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,246
Can I have a cup of tea?

475
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,714
Did you call the police?

476
00:29:10,716 --> 00:29:14,585
Of course I didn't call the police.
I'm not a civilian.

477
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:19,022
These pictures.
They're that man on the telly, aren't they?

478
00:29:19,024 --> 00:29:20,624
-What pictures?
-They're everywhere.

479
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:25,062
Oh, these pictures?
Oh, you can see them too! That's good.

480
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:35,572
Culverton Smith, this I think
is relevant from this morning.

481
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:39,109
He's publicly accused mr Smith
of being a serial killer.

482
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,045
Christ. Sherlock on Twitter.
He really has lost it.

483
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:46,750
Don't you dare make jokes. Don't you dare!
I was terrified.

484
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:47,484
A cup of tea!

485
00:29:47,486 --> 00:29:50,354
Oh, for goodness' sakes!
What's the matter with you?

486
00:29:50,356 --> 00:29:52,990
Are you having an earthquake?

487
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:02,733
-You need to see him, John. You need to help him!
-Nope.

488
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:03,801
He needs you!

489
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,302
Somebody else.

490
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:06,003
Not me. Not now.

491
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:08,172
Now, you just listen to me
for once in your stupid life.

492
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:11,008
I know Mary's dead and I know
your heart is broken.

493
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,311
But if Sherlock Holmes dies
too, who'll you have then?

494
00:30:14,313 --> 00:30:16,713
Because I'll tell you
something, John Watson.

495
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:19,149
You will not have me.

496
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,404
Have you spoken to mycroft,
Molly, anyone?

497
00:30:40,406 --> 00:30:43,106
They don't matter, you do.

498
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:45,642
Would you just see him,
please, John?

499
00:30:45,644 --> 00:30:47,711
Or just take a look at him
as a doctor.

500
00:30:47,713 --> 00:30:50,781
I know you'd change your mind
if you did.

501
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:53,417
Yeah, look. Okay.
Maybe, if I get a chance.

502
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:56,854
-Do you promise?
-I'll try if I'm in the area.

503
00:30:56,856 --> 00:30:58,488
Promise me?

504
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:00,757
-I promise.
-Thank you.

505
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,802
Well? On you go.

506
00:31:11,804 --> 00:31:13,503
Examine him.

507
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:43,200
Right then, mister.
Now I need your handcuffs.

508
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:47,070
I happen to know there's a pair
in the salad drawer.

509
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:49,106
I've borrowed them before.

510
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:49,806
Oh, get over yourself.

511
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:53,477
You're not my first
smack-head, Sherlock Holmes.

512
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,847
That woman's out of control.
I asked for a cup of tea.

513
00:31:56,849 --> 00:32:00,117
-How did you get him in the boot?
-The boys from the cafe.

514
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:00,984
They dropped me. Twice!

515
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,220
And you know why
they dropped you, dear?

516
00:32:03,222 --> 00:32:05,722
Because they know you.

517
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:06,590
Who's this one?

518
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:08,792
Is this a new person?
I'm against new people.

519
00:32:08,794 --> 00:32:10,327
Excuse me for a moment.

520
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,129
She's my therapist.

521
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:14,564
Awesome. Do you do
block bookings?

522
00:32:14,566 --> 00:32:15,365
Whose car is that?

523
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:17,634
-That's my car.
-How can that be your car?

524
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,735
Oh, for god's sake!

525
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,137
I'm the widow of a drug dealer.

526
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:22,105
I own property in central London.

527
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,774
And for the last
bloody time, John,

528
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,409
I'm not your housekeeper.

529
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:29,012
I'm so sorry.
I answered your phone, you were busy.

530
00:32:29,014 --> 00:32:30,681
I think you'll want to take it.

531
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:33,717
-Uh, yes, hello?
-Is this dr John Watson?

532
00:32:33,719 --> 00:32:36,053
Yeah, who's this?

533
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,656
Culverton Smith.
You've probably heard of me.

534
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:40,490
Uh, well, yes.

535
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:43,226
Get me a fresh glass of water, please.
This one's filthy.

536
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:47,831
I mean, I'm aware of
this morning's developments.

537
00:32:48,199 --> 00:32:50,600
Yes, I'm sure
he was being hilarious.

538
00:32:50,602 --> 00:32:53,036
Sorry, did you say
all still meeting?

539
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:54,271
<i> You, me and mr Holmes.</i>

540
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:56,406
I sent a car.
It should be outside.

541
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:57,774
Mr Holmes gave me an address.

542
00:32:57,776 --> 00:33:00,610
Well, he couldn't have
given you this one...

543
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:08,085
When you're ready.

544
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:13,357
When did Sherlock
give you this address?

545
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:15,592
-Two weeks ago.
-Two weeks?

546
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:17,995
<i> Yes. Two weeks.</i>

547
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:21,298
How did you know
where to find me?

548
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,265
Oh, Sherlock told me.

549
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:27,104
He's not so difficult
when you've got a gun on him.

550
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,007
How did you know? How?

551
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:32,376
On Monday, I decided
to get a new therapist.

552
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:33,510
Tuesday afternoon, I chose her.

553
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:38,081
Wednesday morning, I booked today's session.
Now, today is Friday.

554
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:39,049
So two weeks ago, two weeks,

555
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:42,119
before you were abducted at gunpoint, 
and brought here against your will

556
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,087
over a week before I even
thought of coming here,

557
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:48,558
you knew exactly where you need 
to be picked up for lunch?

558
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:50,327
Really?

559
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:54,164
I correctly anticipated the responses of
people I know well to scenarios I devised.

560
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:56,199
-Can't everyone do that?
-How?

561
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:57,567
Except the boot.
The boot was mean.

562
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:01,438
Never mind how. He's dying to tell us that.
I want to know why.

563
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,408
Because mrs Hudson's right.

564
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,475
I'm burning up.

565
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:11,648
I'm at the bottom of a pit and I'm 
still falling, and I'm never climbing out.

566
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:16,620
I need you to know, John.
I need you to see that up here

567
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:17,354
I've still got it.

568
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,222
So, when I tell you that
this is the most dangerous,

569
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:23,160
the most despicable human being 
that I have ever encountered.

570
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:26,563
When I tell you that
this monster must be ended.

571
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:27,764
Please remember
where you're standing

572
00:34:27,766 --> 00:34:32,702
because you're standing exactly where 
I said you would be two weeks ago.

573
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:38,642
I'm a mess, I'm in hell,
but I am not wrong, not about him.

574
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:41,545
So what has all this
got to do with me?

575
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,613
That creature,
that rotting thing

576
00:34:43,615 --> 00:34:46,817
is a living, breathing
coagulation of human evil.

577
00:34:46,819 --> 00:34:49,753
If the only thing I ever do 
in this world is drive him out of it,

578
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:53,690
then my life will not
have been wasted.

579
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,327
Look at me.

580
00:34:57,562 --> 00:35:00,063
Can't do it. Not now.

581
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:02,165
Not alone.

582
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,168
Uh...

583
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:14,010
Yeah, well, they're real
enough, I suppose.

584
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:14,711
Why would I be faking?

585
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,646
Because you're a liar.
You lie all the time, it's like your mission.

586
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:20,517
I have been many things, John,
but when have I ever been a malingerer?

587
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,086
You pretended to be dead
for two years!

588
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,021
-Apart from that.
-Listen, before I do anything,

589
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,189
I need to know
what state you're in.

590
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:28,158
Well, you're a doctor.
Examine me.

591
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,493
No, I need a second opinion.

592
00:35:29,495 --> 00:35:30,460
John, calm down.

593
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,997
When have you ever managed
two opinions? You'd fall over.

594
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:36,399
I need the one person who,
unlike me, learnt to see

595
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:37,667
through your bullshit long ago.

596
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:40,237
Who's that, then? I'm sure
I would have noticed.

597
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,405
The last person you'd think of.

598
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,742
I want you to be examined
by Molly Hooper.

599
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,644
Do you hear me?
I said Molly Hooper.

600
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,779
You're really
not gonna like this.

601
00:35:49,781 --> 00:35:52,382
Like what?

602
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:58,655
Oh. Hello. Is, er...

603
00:35:58,657 --> 00:36:01,324
I'm sorry.
Sherlock asked me to come.

604
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,359
What, two weeks ago?

605
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,226
Yeah, about two weeks.

606
00:36:03,228 --> 00:36:05,729
-If you'd like to know how I predict the future...
-No, I don't care how.

607
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:09,466
Okay. Fully equipped ambulance. 
Molly can examine me on the way to save time.

608
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:12,402
-Ready to go, Molly? Just tell me when to cough.
-Oh, well...

609
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:14,538
Hope you remembered my coat.

610
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,407
Sorry. I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

611
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:21,645
-I have absolutely no idea what's going on.
-Sherlock's using again.

612
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:22,646
Oh, god. Well, um...

613
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:27,150
-Are you sure?
-No, it's Sherlock. Of course I'm not sure.

614
00:36:27,152 --> 00:36:29,486
Just check him out.

615
00:36:31,222 --> 00:36:34,357
Is Molly the right person
to be doing medicals?

616
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,426
She's more used to dead people.

617
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,495
It's bound to lower your standards.

618
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:41,264
I don't know. I don't know
anything any more.

619
00:36:41,266 --> 00:36:44,334
-Oh...
-Mrs Hudson. As ever, you are amazing.

620
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,370
No. You're going to have to
buck up a bit, John.

621
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,105
You know that, don't you?

622
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,507
The game is on.

623
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:51,541
I'll do my best.

624
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:52,609
Anything you need.

625
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:56,213
Anytime. Just ask.
Anything at all.

626
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:58,114
Thank you.

627
00:37:01,686 --> 00:37:06,089
Uh... sometimes,
can I borrow your car?

628
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:07,958
-No.
-Okay.

629
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:14,731
He knew you'd get
a new therapist after I died

630
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:17,267
because you'd need
to change everything.

631
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:19,636
That's just what you're like.

632
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:24,774
Thanks.

633
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,042
You keep your weekends for Rosie

634
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,111
so you needed to see someone
during working hours.

635
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:30,380
Because you're an idiot,
you don't want anyone at the surgery

636
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:32,048
knowing you're in therapy,
so that restricts you

637
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:36,319
to lunchtime sessions
with someone reasonably close.

638
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:38,121
You found four men
and one woman.

639
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:43,026
And you are done with the world 
being explained to you by a man.

640
00:37:43,028 --> 00:37:43,693
Who isn't?

641
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:47,297
So all he needed to do was find the 
first available lunchtime appointment

642
00:37:47,299 --> 00:37:51,001
with a female therapist within 
cycling distance of your surgery.

643
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:52,702
-My god, he knows you.
-No, he doesn't.

644
00:37:52,704 --> 00:37:56,039
I'm in your head, John.
You're disagreeing with yourself.

645
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:58,808
-Are you ready, sir?
-Yes, I am.

646
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,645
He is the cleverest man in the world
but he's not a monster.

647
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:06,082
- Yeah, he is.
- Yeah, okay, right. He is. Ugh.

648
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:08,618
But he's our monster.

649
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,021
I'm a killer.

650
00:38:14,392 --> 00:38:16,526
You know I'm a killer.

651
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,095
But did you know...

652
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:23,633
-I'm a...
-Cut that. What was that? Was that a light?

653
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:29,039
Uh, was that me?
Was I too good? Huh?

654
00:38:29,041 --> 00:38:31,174
He's here.

655
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,352
Well, how is he?

656
00:38:42,354 --> 00:38:43,253
Basically fine.

657
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:44,521
I've seen healthier people
on the slab.

658
00:38:44,523 --> 00:38:48,692
Yeah, but to be fair, you work with 
murder victims. They tend to be quite young.

659
00:38:48,694 --> 00:38:50,627
-Not funny.
-A little bit funny.

660
00:38:50,629 --> 00:38:54,664
If you keep taking what you're taking
at the rate you're taking it,

661
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,465
you've got weeks.

662
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:58,234
Exactly. Weeks.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

663
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,736
For Christ's sake, Sherlock!
It's not a game.

664
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:02,072
I'm worried about you, Molly.
You seem very stressed.

665
00:39:02,074 --> 00:39:03,273
I'm stressed.
You're dying.

666
00:39:03,275 --> 00:39:05,608
Yeah, well, I'm ahead then.
Stress can ruin every day of your life.

667
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,610
-Dying can only ruin one.
-So this is real.

668
00:39:07,612 --> 00:39:09,946
You've really lost it.
You're actually out of control.

669
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:11,948
-When have I ever been that?
-Since the day I met you.

670
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:14,084
Clever boy. Missed you
fumbling around the place.

671
00:39:14,086 --> 00:39:16,519
-Thought this was some kind of...
-What?

672
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:17,387
Trick.

673
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,522
Course it's not a trick.
It's a plan.

674
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:21,057
Mr Holmes?

675
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,194
Thirty feet and closing, the most 
significant undetected serial killer

676
00:39:24,196 --> 00:39:27,063
in British criminal history.
Help me bring him down.

677
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,032
-What, what plan?
-I'm not telling you.

678
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,034
-Why not?
-'Cause you won't like it.

679
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,535
Mr Holmes.

680
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,074
I don't do handshakes.

681
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,410
-It'll have to be a hug.
-I know.

682
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,980
Oh, Sherlock.

683
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:46,716
Oh, Sherlock.

684
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:50,220
What can I say? Thanks to you, 
we're, uh, we're everywhere.

685
00:39:50,222 --> 00:39:53,723
Mr Holmes, how did culverton
talk you into this?

686
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:56,359
Well, he, he's a detective.

687
00:39:56,361 --> 00:39:58,294
Maybe I just confessed.

688
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:01,765
Come on.

689
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,233
Now, it's uh...

690
00:40:03,235 --> 00:40:05,535
It's a new kind
of breakfast cereal...

691
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:07,036
Mr Holmes, can you put on the hat?

692
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,238
Yeah, he doesn't really
wear the hat.

693
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,276
Kids will be getting two of their 
five-a-day before they've even left home.

694
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:16,312
Sherlock's been amazing for us.

695
00:40:16,314 --> 00:40:18,281
Breakfast has got to be cool.

696
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,449
We're beyond viral.

697
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:21,317
You know what makes it cool
when you're a kid?

698
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:23,386
What? Sorry?
Beyond what?

699
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:25,188
Dangerous.

700
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:27,190
And action!

701
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:28,658
I'm a killer.

702
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,693
You know I'm a killer.

703
00:40:33,497 --> 00:40:38,168
But did you know...
I'm a cereal killer?

704
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,672
Mmm.

705
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:45,708
And cut there. Thank you.

706
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:54,384
You should bag that up.
Sell it.

707
00:40:54,386 --> 00:40:56,519
Make money from that on ebay.

708
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,123
You can make more,
if you like. Anytime you like.

709
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:02,625
Has it occurred to you,

710
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:07,030
anywhere in your drug-addled brain,
that you've just been played?

711
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:07,430
Oh, yes.

712
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:10,633
-For an ad campaign.
-Brilliant, isn't it?

713
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,235
Brilliant?

714
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,103
Safest place to hide.

715
00:41:15,673 --> 00:41:17,140
Plain sight.

716
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:17,640
Mr Holmes.

717
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,376
Culverton wants to know if you're 
okay going straight to the hospital.

718
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:24,147
- Hospital?
- Culverton's doing a visit.

719
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:27,283
The kids would love
to meet you both.

720
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,586
I think he's sort of promised.

721
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,521
Oh, okay.

722
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:35,325
If you'd just like
to come this way.

723
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,430
So.

724
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:43,433
What are we doing here?
What's the point?

725
00:41:43,435 --> 00:41:45,401
I needed a hug.

726
00:41:49,306 --> 00:41:51,574
What do you think, mr Holmes?

727
00:41:51,576 --> 00:41:52,642
Cereal killer.

728
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:55,411
It's funny 'cause it's true.

729
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,514
See you at the hospital.

730
00:41:57,516 --> 00:42:00,583
Oh, you can have this back now.

731
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:05,221
-Have what back?
-Thanks for the hug.

732
00:42:05,223 --> 00:42:10,460
Oh, I sent and deleted a text.
You might get a reply but I doubt it.

733
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:13,263
-It's password protected.
-Please.

734
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:19,235
We're going to have endless fun,
mr Holmes. Aren't we?

735
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,803
No.

736
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:22,572
No, not endless.

737
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,779
Need another hit, do you?

738
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:32,615
It can wait until the hospital.

739
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:43,159
You involved, much?

740
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:44,027
Sorry?

741
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:47,297
Um, with mr Holmes,
Sherlock, and all his cases.

742
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:49,332
Yeah, I'm John Watson.

743
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:50,833
Okay.

744
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:51,734
Dr Watson.

745
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,237
-I love his blog. Don't you?
-His blog?

746
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,572
-Don't you read it?
-You mean my blog?

747
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:59,442
Say what you like about addiction, 
the day is full of highlights.

748
00:42:59,444 --> 00:43:01,444
Oh, mr Holmes,
you're feeling better.

749
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:02,312
Psychedelic.

750
00:43:02,314 --> 00:43:04,180
I was just saying
i love your blog.

751
00:43:04,182 --> 00:43:05,548
-Great...
-It's my blog.

752
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,649
It is. He writes the blog.

753
00:43:06,651 --> 00:43:08,518
-It's yours?
-Yes.

754
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,387
-You write Sherlock's blog?
-Yes.

755
00:43:12,489 --> 00:43:15,792
It's gone downhill a bit, hasn't it?

756
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,261
It's this way, then.

757
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,337
Oh, my god. I love your blog.

758
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:28,037
You're welcome.

759
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:30,540
Right. Here he comes.
The Internet tech.

760
00:43:30,542 --> 00:43:32,375
You all know Sherlock Holmes.

761
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,617
Oh, and dr Watson, of course.

762
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:48,124
Mr Holmes, I was wondering.
Well, we all were, weren't we?

763
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:51,561
Maybe you could tell us
about some of your cases.

764
00:43:51,563 --> 00:43:52,729
-No.
-Yes.

765
00:43:52,731 --> 00:43:53,596
Yes! Absolutely, yes!

766
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:57,300
The main feature of interest in
the field of criminal investigation

767
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,302
is not the sensational aspects
of the crime itself

768
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:04,240
but rather, the iron chain
of reasoning from cause to effect,

769
00:44:04,242 --> 00:44:07,110
that reveals, step-by-step,
the solution.

770
00:44:07,112 --> 00:44:09,579
That's the only truly remarkable aspect
of the entire affair.

771
00:44:09,581 --> 00:44:15,985
Now, I will share with you the facts 
and evidence, as they were available to me.

772
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:16,686
And in this very room,

773
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:20,790
you will all attempt to solve the
case of Blessington, the poisoner.

774
00:44:20,792 --> 00:44:22,425
I think you slightly
gave away the ending.

775
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:25,361
-There were five main suspects.
-One called Blessington.

776
00:44:25,363 --> 00:44:27,430
It's more about how he did it.

777
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:28,665
-Poison?
-Okay.

778
00:44:29,334 --> 00:44:33,236
Drearcliff house.
Remember that one, John? One murder.

779
00:44:33,238 --> 00:44:34,804
-Ten suspects.
-Ten. Yeah.

780
00:44:34,806 --> 00:44:37,140
-All of them guilty.
-Sherlock.

781
00:44:37,142 --> 00:44:39,242
And what do you
call that one, John?

782
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:41,177
Um, something to do
with murder at the zoo.

783
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,745
Yeah, I called it
"murder at the zoo."

784
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:46,416
Or was it the case of
the killer orangutan?

785
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,687
He should be wearing the hat.

786
00:44:51,055 --> 00:44:53,122
The kids would love the hat.

787
00:44:53,124 --> 00:44:56,259
-So, any more questions?
-No.

788
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:57,593
-I don't think so.
-No?

789
00:44:57,595 --> 00:45:00,463
-Mr Holmes...
-Good, then I'll...

790
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:04,067
How do you capture
a serial killer?

791
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,370
Same way you catch
any other killer.

792
00:45:07,372 --> 00:45:11,107
No, no. But most killers
kill someone they know.

793
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:14,343
You're looking for a murderer
in a tiny social grouping.

794
00:45:14,345 --> 00:45:16,379
Um, mr Smith.
Um, I'm just, uh, wondering

795
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:20,216
maybe this isn't a suitable subject
for the children.

796
00:45:20,218 --> 00:45:21,317
Nurse Cornish.

797
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:25,321
-How long have you been with us now?
-Seven years.

798
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:29,459
Seven years.

799
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,395
Okay.

800
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,800
Serial killers choose
their victims at random.

801
00:45:37,802 --> 00:45:41,170
Surely that must
make it more difficult.

802
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,773
Some of them advertise.

803
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:45,108
Do they really?

804
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:49,011
Serial killing is an
expression of power, ego.

805
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:52,181
A signature
in human destruction.

806
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:58,721
Ultimately, for full satisfaction, 
it requires plain sight.

807
00:45:58,723 --> 00:46:02,058
Additionally, serial killers
are easily profiled.

808
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,359
They tend to be social outcasts.

809
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:06,329
-Educationally sub-normal.
-No, no, no, no, no.

810
00:46:06,331 --> 00:46:10,133
You're just talking about the ones you know.
The ones you've caught.

811
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:13,069
But, hello, dummy.
You only catch the dumb ones.

812
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:20,977
Now, imagine if the queen wanted to 
kill some people. What would happen then?

813
00:46:20,979 --> 00:46:22,345
All that power, all that money,

814
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:25,448
sweet little government,
dancing attendants.

815
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:30,753
A whole country,
just to keep her warm and fat.

816
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:34,490
Hmm.

817
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,192
We all love the queen, don't we?

818
00:46:36,194 --> 00:46:37,226
And I bet she'd love you lot...

819
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:40,029
It's all right, everyone.
I can personally assure you

820
00:46:40,031 --> 00:46:42,665
that Sherlock Holmes is not
about to arrest the queen.

821
00:46:42,667 --> 00:46:44,500
Well, of course not.

822
00:46:44,502 --> 00:46:46,369
Not her majesty.

823
00:46:46,703 --> 00:46:49,705
Money. Power. Fame.

824
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:53,042
Some things make you untouchable.

825
00:46:53,044 --> 00:46:54,510
God save the queen!

826
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:55,611
She could open a slaughterhouse

827
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:58,447
and we'd all probably
pay the entrance fee.

828
00:46:58,449 --> 00:47:00,416
No one's untouchable.

829
00:47:00,418 --> 00:47:02,385
No one?

830
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,189
Look at you all.

831
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:10,760
So gloomy. Can't you take a joke?
The queen.

832
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:16,465
If the queen was a serial killer, 
I'd be the first person she'd tell.

833
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:18,134
We have that kind of friendship.

834
00:47:18,136 --> 00:47:23,139
A big round of applause for
Sherlock Holmes and dr Watson.

835
00:47:23,141 --> 00:47:26,442
Come on.

836
00:47:26,777 --> 00:47:28,377
Wonderful.

837
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:31,614
Thank you so much for coming.
Thank you.

838
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:36,619
-Where are we going now?
-I want to show you my favourite room.

839
00:47:36,753 --> 00:47:38,621
No, let's go in here.

840
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:43,659
So have you had another one
of your little meetings?

841
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:46,229
Oh, it's just a monthly top-up.

842
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:48,564
Confession is good for the soul.

843
00:47:48,566 --> 00:47:51,734
-Provided you can delete it.
-What's TD 12?

844
00:47:51,736 --> 00:47:53,502
It's a memory inhibitor.

845
00:47:54,004 --> 00:47:55,304
Bliss.

846
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:56,405
Bliss?

847
00:47:56,407 --> 00:47:58,441
Opt-in ignorance.

848
00:47:58,443 --> 00:48:00,009
Makes the world go round.

849
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:01,544
Anyone ever opt to remember?

850
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:06,649
Some people take the drip out.
Yes, some people have the same urges.

851
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:08,150
Now, come on. Wasting time.

852
00:48:08,152 --> 00:48:12,388
Indeed you have,
I estimate, 20 minutes left.

853
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:14,457
-Sorry?
-I sent a text from your phone, remember?

854
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:16,959
It was read almost immediately, 
factoring in a degree of shock,

855
00:48:16,961 --> 00:48:20,496
and emotional decision, and a journey time 
based on the associated address.

856
00:48:20,498 --> 00:48:23,666
I'd say that your life as you know it
has 20 minutes left to run.

857
00:48:23,668 --> 00:48:28,337
Well, no. 17 and a half, to be precise, 
but I rounded up for dramatic effect.

858
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:31,307
So please do show us
your favourite room.

859
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:35,578
It'll give you a chance
to say good-bye.

860
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:39,315
Come along.

861
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:46,322
The game is on.

862
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:48,524
Do you still miss me?

863
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:55,197
Speaking of serial killers,
you know who's my favourite?

864
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:56,766
Other than yourself?

865
00:48:56,768 --> 00:48:59,735
H.H. Holmes.

866
00:48:59,737 --> 00:49:01,304
Relative of yours?

867
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:03,205
Not as far as I know.

868
00:49:03,207 --> 00:49:04,941
You should check.

869
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:06,943
What an idiot.

870
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:10,479
Everyone out.

871
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:16,319
Mr Smith, we're actually
in the middle of something.

872
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,387
Saheed, isn't it?

873
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,389
Saheed. Yes.

874
00:49:20,391 --> 00:49:24,360
-How long have you been working here now?
-Four years.

875
00:49:24,362 --> 00:49:25,962
Four years.

876
00:49:25,964 --> 00:49:29,498
Well, that's a long time, isn't it?

877
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,367
Four years.

878
00:49:34,204 --> 00:49:36,205
Okay, everyone.

879
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:40,343
-Five minutes?
-Come back in ten.

880
00:49:48,218 --> 00:49:49,485
Saheed.

881
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:51,687
This time, knock.

882
00:49:56,193 --> 00:50:00,096
How can you do that?
How... how are you even allowed in here?

883
00:50:00,098 --> 00:50:02,431
Oh, I can go anywhere I like.

884
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:04,700
Anywhere at all.

885
00:50:04,702 --> 00:50:06,435
They gave you keys?

886
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:08,004
They presented them to me.

887
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:08,704
There was a ceremony.

888
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:12,775
You can watch that on YouTube.
The home secretary was there.

889
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:15,745
So, your favourite room.
The mortuary.

890
00:50:15,747 --> 00:50:17,380
What do you think?

891
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:19,348
Tough crowd.

892
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,584
Oh, I don't know.

893
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:25,388
You know, I've always
found them quite pliable.

894
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:26,622
Don't do that.

895
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:28,391
She's fine.

896
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,092
She's dead.

897
00:50:31,328 --> 00:50:33,729
H.H. Holmes loved the dead.

898
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:34,597
He mass-produced them.

899
00:50:34,599 --> 00:50:38,100
Serial killer, active
during the Chicago fair.

900
00:50:38,102 --> 00:50:38,801
You know what he did?

901
00:50:38,803 --> 00:50:41,637
He built a hotel, a special hotel,
just to kill people.

902
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:48,344
You know, with a hanging room,
gas chamber, specially adapted furnace.

903
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:51,113
You know, like Sweeney Todd.

904
00:50:51,115 --> 00:50:53,649
"Without the pies."

905
00:50:55,285 --> 00:50:56,585
Stupid.

906
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,121
So stupid.

907
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,023
Why stupid?

908
00:51:01,025 --> 00:51:01,724
Well, all that effort.

909
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:07,763
You don't build a beach if you want to 
hide a pebble. You just find a beach and...

910
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:14,070
If you wanna hide a murder,
you wanna hide lots and lots of murders,

911
00:51:14,204 --> 00:51:16,105
just find a...

912
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,474
Hospital.

913
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:22,078
Can we be clear?
Are you confessing?

914
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,412
To what?

915
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,115
The way you're talking.

916
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,384
Oh, sorry.

917
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,086
Yes.

918
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,288
You mean, am I a serial killer?

919
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,258
Or am I just trying to mess
with your funny little head?

920
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:36,792
Well, it's true.

921
00:51:36,794 --> 00:51:43,332
I do like to mess with people, and yes, 
I am a bit creepy but that's just my usp.

922
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:45,768
I use it to sell
breakfast cereal.

923
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:48,170
But am I what he says I am?

924
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:50,439
Is that what you're asking?

925
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:52,475
-Yes.
-Hmm.

926
00:51:52,477 --> 00:51:55,678
Well. Let me ask you this.

927
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:59,248
-Are you really a doctor?
-Yeah, of course I am.

928
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,450
Oh. Well, no, a medical doctor,

929
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:06,222
you know, not just feet or
media studies or something.

930
00:52:06,224 --> 00:52:07,790
I'm a doctor.

931
00:52:09,693 --> 00:52:11,360
Are you serious?

932
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,529
No, really.

933
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,598
Are you?

934
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:20,769
Are you, are you
actually serious?

935
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:23,105
I've played along
with this joke.

936
00:52:23,107 --> 00:52:24,807
It's not funny any more.

937
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:26,609
You know, look at him.

938
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:30,546
Go ahead, look at him,
dr Watson. Hmm?

939
00:52:30,548 --> 00:52:31,680
Oh no, I'll lay it
out for you.

940
00:52:31,682 --> 00:52:35,484
There are two possible explanations
for what's going on here.

941
00:52:35,486 --> 00:52:38,254
Either I'm a serial killer,

942
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:42,558
or Sherlock Holmes is
off his tits on drugs. Hmm?

943
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,395
Delusional paranoia
about a public personality.

944
00:52:46,397 --> 00:52:48,697
That's not so special.
It's not even new.

945
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:52,234
I think you need to tell
your faithful little friend

946
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:56,539
how you're wasting his time
because you're too high

947
00:52:56,541 --> 00:52:59,575
to know what's real any more.

948
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:06,482
I apologise.

949
00:53:07,150 --> 00:53:09,718
I miscalculated.

950
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:13,389
I forgot to
factor in the traffic.

951
00:53:13,391 --> 00:53:17,293
Nineteen and a half minutes.

952
00:53:18,129 --> 00:53:20,596
Ah, the footsteps you're about to hear
will be very familiar to you,

953
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:23,432
not least because there'll be
three impacts rather than two.

954
00:53:23,434 --> 00:53:27,336
The third of course, will be
the end of a walking cane.

955
00:53:28,438 --> 00:53:31,207
Your daughter Faith's
walking cane.

956
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,775
Why would she be here?

957
00:53:32,777 --> 00:53:34,376
You invited her.

958
00:53:34,378 --> 00:53:35,678
You sent her a text.
Or, or, or,

959
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:39,815
technically I sent her a text,
but she's not to know.

960
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:44,053
Um, let's see if I can recall.

961
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:47,456
"Faith, I can stand it no longer."

962
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:50,593
"I've confessed to my crimes."

963
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:52,094
"Please forgive me."

964
00:53:52,096 --> 00:53:54,463
How would that
have any effect?

965
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:55,831
You don't know her.

966
00:53:55,833 --> 00:53:57,633
Oh, but I do.

967
00:53:57,635 --> 00:54:00,603
I spent a whole evening with her.

968
00:54:00,605 --> 00:54:02,671
We had chips.

969
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:03,639
I think she liked me.

970
00:54:03,641 --> 00:54:06,609
You don't know Faith.
You simply do not.

971
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:09,011
I know you care
about her deeply.

972
00:54:09,013 --> 00:54:12,715
I know you invited her to one 
of your special board meetings.

973
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:16,085
You care what she thinks.

974
00:54:16,786 --> 00:54:21,523
You maintain an impressive facade.

975
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,127
I think it's about to break.

976
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,095
Did you know?

977
00:54:26,097 --> 00:54:29,265
-She came to Baker street.
-No, she didn't.

978
00:54:29,267 --> 00:54:30,432
Of course I didn't.

979
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,301
She came to see me

980
00:54:32,303 --> 00:54:33,802
because she was scared
of her daddy.

981
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:39,475
Never happened. Is this another one 
of your drug-fuelled fantasies?

982
00:54:39,477 --> 00:54:41,777
-You didn't you see him take the scalpel?
-Nobody saw it.

983
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:45,748
-So you didn't know what was about to happen?
-Of course I didn't know.

984
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:46,682
Well, let's see, shall we?

985
00:54:46,684 --> 00:54:49,018
Faith, stop loitering
at the door and come in.

986
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,121
This is your father's
favourite room.

987
00:54:53,723 --> 00:54:56,825
Come and meet his best friends.

988
00:54:57,227 --> 00:55:00,562
Faith: Dad? What's happening?

989
00:55:00,564 --> 00:55:02,164
What was that text?

990
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:06,402
Another one of your jokes?

991
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:08,103
Who are you?

992
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,157
Who the hell are you?

993
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,593
Sherlock Holmes.
Surely you recognise him.

994
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:33,662
Oh, my god.

995
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:36,065
Sherlock Holmes?

996
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:37,032
I love your blog.

997
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:40,402
You're not her. You're not the woman
who came to Baker street.

998
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:42,471
Erm, well, no.
Never been there.

999
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:46,041
Well, there must've been some build-up.
He didn't just suddenly do it.

1000
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:48,143
Look, I didn't know
he had the bloody scalpel.

1001
00:55:48,145 --> 00:55:50,012
Sorry, I'm not sure
I completely understand.

1002
00:55:50,014 --> 00:55:56,085
-Understand what?
-But I thought you two were, were old friends!

1003
00:55:56,087 --> 00:55:58,354
No, we've never met.

1004
00:55:58,356 --> 00:56:00,289
Oh, dear!

1005
00:56:00,291 --> 00:56:02,624
Have we?

1006
00:56:02,626 --> 00:56:04,193
Sherlock?

1007
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:06,295
So who came to my flat?

1008
00:56:06,297 --> 00:56:10,666
Well, it wasn't me.

1009
00:56:11,601 --> 00:56:14,036
You look different.

1010
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:16,138
I wasn't there.

1011
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,339
Who came to my flat?

1012
00:56:17,341 --> 00:56:20,109
<i> I'm sorry, mr Holmes, but...</i>

1013
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:24,580
I don't think I've ever been
anywhere near your flat.

1014
00:56:24,582 --> 00:56:27,750
Oh, dear. Oh, no.

1015
00:56:27,752 --> 00:56:29,551
<i> Who you talking to?</i>

1016
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:32,688
<i> -What friend?</i>
<i> -Anyone.</i>

1017
00:56:33,056 --> 00:56:35,657
Oh, no!

1018
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,028
Faith?

1019
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,499
Oh god. Come on.

1020
00:56:54,310 --> 00:56:55,677
Sherlock.

1021
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,080
Sherlock, you all right?
Sherlock, you okay?

1022
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,448
-Watch him. He's got a knife.
-Got a what?

1023
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:03,385
Got a scalpel. You picked it up 
from that table. I saw you take it.

1024
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:05,053
I certainly did not!

1025
00:57:05,055 --> 00:57:06,054
Look behind his back!

1026
00:57:06,056 --> 00:57:09,191
- Look.
- I saw you take it! I saw you!

1027
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:12,394
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Sherlock, put that down.

1028
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:15,431
-Oh my god. My god!
-Put it down.

1029
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:18,066
-Stop laughing at me.
-I'm not laughing.

1030
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:20,969
-He's not laughing, Sherlock.
-Stop laughing at me!

1031
00:57:20,971 --> 00:57:22,704
Sherlock!

1032
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:26,175
Christ.

1033
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,445
I keep wondering if we
should've seen it coming.

1034
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:32,014
Not long ago, he shot
Charles magnussen in the face.

1035
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:34,750
We did see it coming.
We always saw it coming.

1036
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:37,152
But it was fun.

1037
00:57:37,154 --> 00:57:39,388
-Come in.
-Sir.

1038
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:41,690
You probably wanna see this.

1039
00:57:44,093 --> 00:57:46,361
<i> Harold Chorley</i>
<i> reporting earlier today.</i>

1040
00:57:46,363 --> 00:57:50,999
<i> Mr Smith stated he had</i>
<i> no interest in bringing charges.</i>

1041
00:57:51,001 --> 00:57:53,769
<i> I'm a fan of Sherlock Holmes,</i>
<i> I'm a big fan.</i>

1042
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:57,239
<i> I don't really know what</i>
<i> happened today. To be honest,</i>

1043
00:57:57,241 --> 00:58:02,110
<i> I don't think I'd be standing here now</i>
<i> if it wasn't for dr Watson.</i>

1044
00:58:02,112 --> 00:58:04,446
Stop laughing at me!

1045
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:07,216
Sherlock!

1046
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,084
Stop it! Stop it now!

1047
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,719
<i> Is it true he's been</i>
<i> treated in your hospital?</i>

1048
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:15,557
<i> It's not actually my hospital.</i>
<i> Well, it is a little bit my hospital.</i>

1049
00:58:15,559 --> 00:58:20,295
<i> But I can promise you this.</i>
<i> He's going to get</i>
<i> the best of care.</i>

1050
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,364
<i> I might even move him</i>
<i> to my favourite room.</i>

1051
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:25,434
<i> Culverton Smith, earlier today.</i>

1052
00:58:25,436 --> 00:58:27,102
<i> In Nottingham...</i>

1053
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:35,244
He's right you know,
you probably saved his life.

1054
00:58:35,246 --> 00:58:37,312
What are you doing? Wake up!

1055
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:41,149
I really hit him, Greg.
Hit him hard.

1056
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,456
Is this a game?
A bloody game.

1057
00:58:55,565 --> 00:58:58,400
Please, please, please,
no violence.

1058
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,970
Thank you, dr Watson.

1059
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:04,706
I don't think he's
a danger any more.

1060
00:59:05,441 --> 00:59:06,675
Leave him be.

1061
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:08,143
No.

1062
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:10,012
It's okay.

1063
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:13,949
Let him do what he wants.

1064
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,285
He's entitled.

1065
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,622
I killed his wife.

1066
00:59:23,026 --> 00:59:24,960
Yes, you did.

1067
01:00:02,165 --> 01:00:03,432
Oh, hi.

1068
01:00:05,068 --> 01:00:06,802
Just in to say hello?

1069
01:00:06,804 --> 01:00:08,704
No, I'm just in to say goodbye.

1070
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:10,305
I'm sure he'll pull through.

1071
01:00:10,307 --> 01:00:11,773
Yeah, he's made a terrible
mess of himself,

1072
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:17,512
but, he's awfully strong, so, 
we must look on the bright side.

1073
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,422
Well...

1074
01:00:28,491 --> 01:00:29,558
Parting gift.

1075
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,326
Aww, that's nice.

1076
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,027
A walking stick.

1077
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:35,397
Yeah, it was mine from
a long time ago.

1078
01:00:38,435 --> 01:00:40,502
Hello? Ward 73.

1079
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:42,671
Oh, uh, dr Watson...

1080
01:00:42,673 --> 01:00:44,072
Hmm?

1081
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:46,108
It's for you.

1082
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:50,545
Hello, Mycroft.

1083
01:00:50,547 --> 01:00:53,148
<i> There's a car downstairs.</i>

1084
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:59,354
You know he should
definitely have worn the hat.

1085
01:00:59,356 --> 01:01:01,089
Still thinking about Sherlock?

1086
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,257
No, you are.

1087
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:03,458
You've got your
disapproving face on.

1088
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:08,397
Well, seeing as I'm inside your head, 
I think we can call that self-loathing.

1089
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,148
Where is she?
Where is mrs Hudson?

1090
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:01,249
She'll be up in a moment.

1091
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:02,384
-Uh, what are you doing?
-Sorry...

1092
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:04,186
Have you noticed the kitchen?
It's practically a meth lab.

1093
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:09,391
I'm trying to establish exactly what 
drove Sherlock off the rails, any ideas?

1094
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:10,625
Are these spooks?

1095
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:14,696
Are you using spooks now,
to look after your family.

1096
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:16,098
Hang on, are they tidying?

1097
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,365
Sherlock is a security concern.

1098
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:19,067
The fact that I'm his
brother changes nothing.

1099
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:21,803
-Yeah you said that before.
-Ask him.

1100
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:24,673
Why fixate on culverton Smith?

1101
01:02:24,675 --> 01:02:26,708
He's had his obsessions
before, of course.

1102
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:27,743
But this goes a
bit further than

1103
01:02:27,745 --> 01:02:30,178
setting a man trap
for father Christmas.

1104
01:02:30,180 --> 01:02:30,712
Do it. Ask him.

1105
01:02:30,714 --> 01:02:32,647
Spending all night talking to
a woman who wasn't even there.

1106
01:02:32,649 --> 01:02:35,383
-Oh shut up, you.
-Mycroft, last time when we were on the phone...

1107
01:02:35,385 --> 01:02:39,187
No, no, no, stop.
I detest conversation in the past tense.

1108
01:02:39,189 --> 01:02:43,091
You said the fact that you're 
his brother made no difference.

1109
01:02:43,093 --> 01:02:43,625
It doesn't.

1110
01:02:43,627 --> 01:02:45,594
You said it didn't the last time, 
and it wouldn't with Sherlock.

1111
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:50,031
-So who was it the last time? Who are you talking about?
-Atta boy.

1112
01:02:50,033 --> 01:02:51,533
Nobody.

1113
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:53,268
I misspoke.

1114
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,270
-He's lying.
-You're lying.

1115
01:02:55,272 --> 01:02:56,338
I assure you I'm not.

1116
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,473
He really is lying.

1117
01:02:58,475 --> 01:03:01,276
Sherlock's not
your only brother.

1118
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,512
There's another one, isn't there?

1119
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:04,780
- No.
- Jesus.

1120
01:03:04,782 --> 01:03:09,117
A secret brother.
What, is he locked up in a tower or something?

1121
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,153
Mycroft Holmes.

1122
01:03:11,155 --> 01:03:14,256
What are these dreadful
people doing in my house?

1123
01:03:14,258 --> 01:03:16,024
Mrs Hudson I apologise
for the interruption.

1124
01:03:16,026 --> 01:03:19,561
As you know, my brother has embarked 
in a programme of self-destruction,

1125
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:21,196
remarkable even by his standards,

1126
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:23,765
and I'm endeavouring
to find out what triggered it.

1127
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:27,035
-And that's what you're looking for?
-Quite so.

1128
01:03:27,037 --> 01:03:27,702
What's on his mind?

1129
01:03:27,704 --> 01:03:29,471
-So to speak.
-And you've had all this time?

1130
01:03:29,473 --> 01:03:33,008
Time being something of which 
we don't have an infinite supply.

1131
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:35,443
So, if we could be
about our business.

1132
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:40,515
You're so funny, you are!

1133
01:03:40,517 --> 01:03:41,683
Mrs Hudson?

1134
01:03:41,685 --> 01:03:43,285
He thinks you're clever.

1135
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:44,619
Poor old Sherlock.

1136
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:45,787
Always going on about you.

1137
01:03:45,789 --> 01:03:47,055
I mean he knows you're an idiot.

1138
01:03:47,057 --> 01:03:49,090
But that's okay, 'cause
you are a lovely doctor.

1139
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:52,327
But he has no idea
what an idiot you are!

1140
01:03:52,329 --> 01:03:54,596
Is this merely stream
of consciousness abuse,

1141
01:03:54,598 --> 01:03:56,231
or are you attempting
to make a point?

1142
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:57,732
You want to know what's
bothering Sherlock?

1143
01:03:57,734 --> 01:04:00,135
Easiest thing in the world.
Anyone can do it.

1144
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:04,206
I know his thoughts processes
better than any other human being.

1145
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,540
So please try to understand.

1146
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:07,776
He's not about thinking.
Not Sherlock.

1147
01:04:07,778 --> 01:04:11,746
-Of course he is.
-No. He's more emotional, isn't he?

1148
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:15,684
Unsolved case,
shoot the wall.

1149
01:04:15,686 --> 01:04:18,420
Unmade breakfast
karate the fridge.

1150
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:19,254
Unanswered questions...

1151
01:04:19,256 --> 01:04:22,524
Well, what does he do with anything 
he can't answer, John?

1152
01:04:22,526 --> 01:04:24,392
Every time.

1153
01:04:24,394 --> 01:04:25,093
He stabs it.

1154
01:04:25,095 --> 01:04:29,064
Anything he can't find
the answer for, bang! It's up there.

1155
01:04:29,066 --> 01:04:35,604
I keep telling you, if he was any good 
as the detective I wouldn't need a new mantle.

1156
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:42,110
<i> If you're watching this, I'm...</i>

1157
01:04:42,578 --> 01:04:43,278
<i> Probably dead.</i>

1158
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,081
Okay no, stop that now, please.

1159
01:04:46,083 --> 01:04:48,617
Everybody out now.

1160
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:49,451
All of you!

1161
01:04:49,453 --> 01:04:54,289
This is my house, this is my friend, 
and that's his departed wife.

1162
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:55,790
Anyone who stays
here a minute longer

1163
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:58,126
is admitting to me personally,
they do not have

1164
01:04:58,128 --> 01:05:01,363
a single spark of human decency.

1165
01:05:10,573 --> 01:05:12,474
Get out of my house.

1166
01:05:12,476 --> 01:05:14,476
You reptile.

1167
01:05:23,185 --> 01:05:26,121
You've been ages wakin' up.

1168
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:28,189
I watched you.

1169
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:31,760
It was quite lovely in its way.

1170
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:34,763
Take it easy, it's okay.

1171
01:05:34,765 --> 01:05:37,666
I don't want to rush this.

1172
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,001
You're Sherlock Holmes.

1173
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:43,371
<i> I'm giving you</i>
<i> a case, Sherlock.</i>

1174
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:46,441
<i> Might be the hardest</i>
<i> case of your career.</i>

1175
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:48,743
<i> When I'm...</i>

1176
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,146
<i> Gone, if I'm gone.</i>

1177
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:54,149
<i> I need you to do</i>
<i> something for me.</i>

1178
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,285
<i> Save John Watson.</i>

1179
01:05:58,020 --> 01:05:59,254
<i> Save him.</i>

1180
01:05:59,256 --> 01:05:59,821
<i> Sherlock...</i>

1181
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:02,691
John, you want to
watch this later?

1182
01:06:02,693 --> 01:06:03,425
<i> Save him.</i>

1183
01:06:03,427 --> 01:06:07,963
<i> Don't think anyone else is going</i>
<i> to save him because there isn't anyone.</i>

1184
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:10,632
<i> It's up to you. Save him.</i>

1185
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:13,134
<i> But I do think you're going</i>
<i> to need a little help with that,</i>

1186
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,569
<i> because you're not</i>
<i> exactly good with people.</i>

1187
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:18,373
<i> So here's a few things you need</i>
<i> to know about the man we both love.</i>

1188
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:23,278
<i> And more importantly, what you're</i>
<i> going to need to do to save him.</i>

1189
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,218
How did you get in?

1190
01:06:31,020 --> 01:06:33,154
Policemen outside, you mean?

1191
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:36,658
Come on, can't you guess?

1192
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:40,996
Secret door.

1193
01:06:41,197 --> 01:06:43,398
I built this whole wing.

1194
01:06:43,400 --> 01:06:47,068
Kept firing the architect
who built it, so no one

1195
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:50,572
knew quite,
how it all fitted together.

1196
01:06:50,574 --> 01:06:53,441
I can slip in and out.

1197
01:06:53,443 --> 01:06:56,111
Whenever I like, you know.

1198
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:58,013
When I get the urge.

1199
01:06:58,015 --> 01:06:59,748
H.H. Holmes.

1200
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:03,551
Murder castle, but done right.

1201
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:05,954
I have a question for you.

1202
01:07:05,956 --> 01:07:06,588
Why you are here?

1203
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:11,459
It's like you walked into my den 
and laid down in front of me.

1204
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:13,762
Why?

1205
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,364
You know why I'm here.

1206
01:07:16,366 --> 01:07:19,467
I'd like to hear you say it.

1207
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,736
Say it for me please.

1208
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,741
I want you to kill me.

1209
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,348
John.

1210
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:36,551
My car.

1211
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:43,691
Increase the dosage four, 
five times, the toxic shock

1212
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:47,529
should shut me down,
within about an hour.

1213
01:07:47,531 --> 01:07:49,664
Then I'll restore the settings.

1214
01:07:49,666 --> 01:07:53,334
Everyone assumes
that it was a fault, or...

1215
01:07:53,336 --> 01:07:57,138
-You just gave up the ghost.
-Yes.

1216
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,442
You are good at this.

1217
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:06,414
Before we start,
tell me how you feel.

1218
01:08:07,650 --> 01:08:09,084
I...

1219
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:12,120
I feel scared.

1220
01:08:12,288 --> 01:08:13,955
Be more specific.

1221
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:16,958
You only get to do
this the once.

1222
01:08:17,960 --> 01:08:19,461
Scared of dying.

1223
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:22,163
You wanted this though.

1224
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,533
I have reasons.

1225
01:08:25,535 --> 01:08:29,070
But you don't
actually want to die.

1226
01:08:29,072 --> 01:08:30,405
No.

1227
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:32,474
Good.

1228
01:08:35,010 --> 01:08:36,544
Say that for me.

1229
01:08:36,546 --> 01:08:39,447
-Say it.
-I don't want to die.

1230
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:42,016
And again.

1231
01:08:42,018 --> 01:08:45,186
I don't want to die.

1232
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,692
Once more for luck.

1233
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,228
I don't want to die.

1234
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:55,630
I don't...

1235
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:58,133
I don't want to die.

1236
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,236
Lovely.

1237
01:09:03,539 --> 01:09:05,140
Here it comes.

1238
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:13,581
<i> Please, I don't</i>
<i> think he's safe.</i>

1239
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,484
<i> No, he's fine, got a man on the door.</i>
<i> What do you think's happened?</i>

1240
01:09:16,486 --> 01:09:19,687
I don't know, something.
Mary left a message.

1241
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:21,156
What message?

1242
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:22,524
<i> John Watson,</i>

1243
01:09:22,526 --> 01:09:25,093
<i> never accepts help,</i>
<i> not from anyone.</i>

1244
01:09:25,095 --> 01:09:29,030
<i> Not ever, but here's the thing</i>
<i> he never refuses it.</i>

1245
01:09:29,032 --> 01:09:32,433
<i> So, here's is what</i>
<i> you are going to do.</i>

1246
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:35,770
So tell me, why
are we doing this?

1247
01:09:35,772 --> 01:09:38,273
To what do I owe the pleasure?

1248
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:41,042
I wanted to hear your confession.

1249
01:09:41,044 --> 01:09:43,411
Needed to know I was right.

1250
01:09:43,413 --> 01:09:45,380
Why do you need to die?

1251
01:09:45,382 --> 01:09:47,415
The mortuary,

1252
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:49,417
your favourite room.

1253
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,720
You talk to the dead.

1254
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:56,224
You make your confession to them.

1255
01:09:58,260 --> 01:10:00,795
I'm sorry, sir, what?
What do you mean?

1256
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:03,798
I think the door is jammed.

1257
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:06,434
Oh, has that door
locked itself again?

1258
01:10:06,436 --> 01:10:07,502
Yeah, it's always doing that.

1259
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:11,239
<i> You can't save John,</i>
<i> because he won't let you.</i>

1260
01:10:11,241 --> 01:10:14,809
<i> He won't allow</i>
<i> himself to be saved.</i>

1261
01:10:15,444 --> 01:10:18,313
<i> The only way to save John,</i>

1262
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:20,048
<i> is to make him save you.</i>

1263
01:10:20,050 --> 01:10:22,150
Why do you do it?

1264
01:10:23,352 --> 01:10:25,053
Why do I kill?

1265
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:29,791
It's not about hatred or revenge.

1266
01:10:29,793 --> 01:10:32,327
I'm not a dark person.

1267
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,729
Killing human beings...

1268
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,437
It just makes me...

1269
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:45,673
Ah. Incredibly happy.

1270
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,616
You know, in films when
you see dead people,

1271
01:10:54,618 --> 01:11:00,221
pretending to be dead, and it's 
just living people lying down?

1272
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:04,525
That's not what
dead people are like.

1273
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,728
Dead people

1274
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,063
look like things.

1275
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:13,067
I like to make people
into things.

1276
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:14,736
Then you can own them.

1277
01:11:14,738 --> 01:11:19,240
You know what, I'm getting 
a little impatient.

1278
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:36,190
Take a big breath if you want.

1279
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,160
<i> Go to hell, Sherlock.</i>

1280
01:11:41,463 --> 01:11:42,363
<i> Go right into hell.</i>

1281
01:11:42,365 --> 01:11:44,499
<i> And make it look like</i>
<i> you mean it.</i>

1282
01:11:44,501 --> 01:11:47,802
Murder is a very difficult
addiction to manage.

1283
01:11:47,804 --> 01:11:50,705
People don't realise how
much work goes into it.

1284
01:11:50,707 --> 01:11:51,639
You have to be careful.

1285
01:11:51,641 --> 01:11:55,810
But if you're rich,
or and famous and loved,

1286
01:11:55,812 --> 01:12:00,281
it's amazing what people
are prepared to ignore.

1287
01:12:00,283 --> 01:12:04,252
There's always someone desperate
about to go missing,

1288
01:12:04,254 --> 01:12:09,791
and no one is supposed to suspect 
murder if it's easier to suspect

1289
01:12:09,793 --> 01:12:10,725
something else.

1290
01:12:10,727 --> 01:12:14,262
I just have to ration myself, 
choose the right heart to stop.

1291
01:12:14,264 --> 01:12:20,501
<i> Go and pick a fight with a bad guy,</i>
<i> put yourself in harm's way.</i>

1292
01:12:20,736 --> 01:12:23,404
Maintain eye contact.

1293
01:12:23,406 --> 01:12:25,640
Maintain eye contact.

1294
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:27,709
Maintain eye contact.

1295
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:31,179
I like to watch it happen.

1296
01:12:31,181 --> 01:12:35,283
<i> If he thinks you</i>
<i> need him, I swear...</i>

1297
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:43,825
And off we pop.

1298
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:46,728
<i> He will be there.</i>

1299
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:51,466
Mr Holmes, you okay?

1300
01:12:51,468 --> 01:12:53,468
What were you doing to him? 
What were you doing!

1301
01:12:53,470 --> 01:12:56,771
-He's in distress, I'm helping him!
-Restrain him now, do it.

1302
01:12:56,773 --> 01:13:00,441
-I was trying to help him!
-Sherlock, what was he doing to you?

1303
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:01,376
Suffocating me.

1304
01:13:01,378 --> 01:13:03,177
-Overdosing me.
-On what?

1305
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:03,778
-Saline.
-Saline?

1306
01:13:03,780 --> 01:13:06,347
- Yeah, saline.
- What do you mean, saline?

1307
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:10,451
Well you see, I got ms Cornish
to switch the bags.

1308
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:12,353
She's a big fan, you know.

1309
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:13,388
Loves my blog.

1310
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:15,323
-You're okay?
-No of course I'm not okay.

1311
01:13:15,325 --> 01:13:16,724
Malnourished, 
double kidney failure,

1312
01:13:16,726 --> 01:13:19,594
and frankly, I've been
off my tits for weeks.

1313
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:21,662
What kind of doctor are you?

1314
01:13:21,664 --> 01:13:24,665
I got my confession
though, didn't I?

1315
01:13:24,667 --> 01:13:27,201
Well, I didn't recall
making any confession.

1316
01:13:27,203 --> 01:13:28,503
What would I be confessing to?

1317
01:13:28,505 --> 01:13:32,373
-You can listen to it later.
-Well, there is no confession to listen to.

1318
01:13:32,375 --> 01:13:35,076
Oh, mr Holmes I don't know
if this is relevant but,

1319
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:40,047
we found three potential recording devices,
in the pockets of your coat.

1320
01:13:40,049 --> 01:13:44,018
All your possessions
were searched. Sorry.

1321
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:49,056
There must be something
comforting about the number three,

1322
01:13:49,058 --> 01:13:52,660
people always
give up after three.

1323
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,466
What? What is it? What?

1324
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:02,670
Oh...

1325
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:05,206
-You cock.
-Yeah.

1326
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,674
Utter, utter cock.

1327
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:09,043
Heard you the first time.

1328
01:14:13,348 --> 01:14:15,082
How does that open?

1329
01:14:15,084 --> 01:14:16,684
Screw the top.

1330
01:14:23,425 --> 01:14:25,159
-Two weeks ago?
-Three.

1331
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:26,794
I'm that predictable?

1332
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:28,429
No.

1333
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,066
I'm just a cock.

1334
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:44,111
It's funny.

1335
01:14:44,113 --> 01:14:48,516
Never realised confessing
would be so enjoyable.

1336
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:51,152
Should have done it sooner.

1337
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:53,054
We'll carry on tomorrow.

1338
01:14:53,056 --> 01:14:57,258
Well, we could carry on now,
I'm not tired.

1339
01:14:57,260 --> 01:14:58,826
There's a loads more.

1340
01:14:58,828 --> 01:14:59,527
Tomorrow.

1341
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:04,131
You know,
I am gonna be so famous now.

1342
01:15:04,133 --> 01:15:06,067
You're already famous.

1343
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,402
Yeah, but this...

1344
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:11,706
I could break America.

1345
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:17,378
<i> I had of course</i>
<i> several other back up plans.</i>

1346
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:20,481
<i> The trouble is, I couldn't</i>
<i> remember what they were.</i>

1347
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:23,017
And of course I hadn't
been anticipated

1348
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:25,753
that I'd hallucinated
meeting his daughter.

1349
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:27,388
Basically he trashed
himself on drugs

1350
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:29,323
so that you'll help him,
so that you'd have something to do,

1351
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:31,993
something doctory,
you get that now, don't you?

1352
01:15:31,995 --> 01:15:34,595
Still a bit troubled
by the daughter.

1353
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:35,429
Did seem very real.

1354
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:39,300
She gave me information I couldn't 
have acquired elsewhere.

1355
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:41,235
But she wasn't ever here?

1356
01:15:41,237 --> 01:15:42,503
Interesting, isn't it?
I have theorised before

1357
01:15:42,505 --> 01:15:46,340
that if one could attenuate to every available 
data stream in the world simultaneously,

1358
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:51,746
it would be possible to anticipate 
and deduce almost anything.

1359
01:15:52,481 --> 01:15:52,813
Hmm.

1360
01:15:52,815 --> 01:15:55,616
So you dreamed up a magic woman who 
told you things you didn't know?

1361
01:15:55,618 --> 01:15:59,353
That sounds about right to me.
Possibly I'm biased.

1362
01:15:59,355 --> 01:16:04,659
Perhaps the drugs opened
certain doors in my mind.

1363
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,195
-I'm intrigued.
-Look, I know you are.

1364
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:12,333
Which is why we're all taking it in 
turns to keep you off the sweeties.

1365
01:16:12,335 --> 01:16:16,037
I thought we were
just hanging out.

1366
01:16:17,306 --> 01:16:18,406
Molly will be here
in 20 minutes.

1367
01:16:18,408 --> 01:16:23,578
Oh, I do think I can last 
twenty minutes without supervision.

1368
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:26,314
Well, if you're sure.

1369
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:29,450
Christ, John, stay, talk.

1370
01:16:29,651 --> 01:16:33,020
Um, sorry, it's just, uh,
you know, Rosie.

1371
01:16:33,022 --> 01:16:33,721
Yes, of course, Rosie.

1372
01:16:33,723 --> 01:16:36,991
Go and solve a crime together,
make him wear the hat.

1373
01:16:36,993 --> 01:16:39,694
-You'll be okay for 20 minutes?
-Yes, yes.

1374
01:16:39,696 --> 01:16:41,529
Sorry, I wasn't
thinking of Rosie.

1375
01:16:41,531 --> 01:16:44,031
-No problem. Listen, uh...
-We should, uh...

1376
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:46,500
I'll come and see you, soon.

1377
01:16:47,169 --> 01:16:47,501
Yes.

1378
01:16:47,503 --> 01:16:49,337
Actually, he should wear the hat 
as a special tribute to me.

1379
01:16:49,339 --> 01:16:51,372
I'm dead.
I would really appreciate it.

1380
01:16:51,374 --> 01:16:55,009
Oh, by the way, the recordings 
will probably be inadmissible.

1381
01:16:55,011 --> 01:16:56,711
-Sorry what?
-Well, technically it's entrapment, so...

1382
01:16:56,713 --> 01:16:59,480
It might get thrown out as evidence.
Not that that matters.

1383
01:16:59,482 --> 01:17:02,283
Apparently he can't
stop confessing.

1384
01:17:02,285 --> 01:17:04,619
-That's good.
-Yeah.

1385
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,593
Are you okay?

1386
01:17:12,595 --> 01:17:14,495
No, I'm not okay.

1387
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:15,563
I'm never gonna be okay.

1388
01:17:15,565 --> 01:17:19,500
We just have to accept that. 
It is what it is.

1389
01:17:19,502 --> 01:17:21,469
And what it is, is...

1390
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:24,071
-Shit.
-John, do better.

1391
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:28,609
You didn't kill Mary.

1392
01:17:28,611 --> 01:17:30,344
Mary died saving your life.

1393
01:17:30,346 --> 01:17:31,045
It's her choice.

1394
01:17:31,047 --> 01:17:33,447
No one made her do it,
no one could ever make her do anything.

1395
01:17:33,449 --> 01:17:35,082
But the point is,

1396
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:37,551
you did not kill her.

1397
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:42,490
In saving my life
she conferred a value on it.

1398
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:46,527
It is a currency I do not
know how to spend.

1399
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,533
It is what it is.

1400
01:17:55,237 --> 01:17:58,039
I'm tomorrow six till ten,
I'll see you then.

1401
01:17:58,041 --> 01:17:59,674
Looking forward to it.

1402
01:17:59,808 --> 01:18:01,275
Yeah.

1403
01:18:04,047 --> 01:18:08,349
-That noise, that's a text alert noise.
-What was that?

1404
01:18:10,085 --> 01:18:10,685
Hmm? What was what?

1405
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:15,156
That's the text alert of Irene Adler, 
she's the scary mad one, right?

1406
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:16,223
That noise.

1407
01:18:16,225 --> 01:18:17,358
What noise?

1408
01:18:17,360 --> 01:18:18,726
She's dead.

1409
01:18:18,728 --> 01:18:23,230
Oh I bet she isn't dead.
I bet he saved her.

1410
01:18:23,232 --> 01:18:24,732
Oh, my god!

1411
01:18:24,734 --> 01:18:27,368
Oh, the posh boy
loves the dominatrix!

1412
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:31,005
He's never knowingly
under-cliched, is he?

1413
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:32,306
John?

1414
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:33,374
I'm gonna make a deduction.

1415
01:18:33,376 --> 01:18:36,143
-Oh okay, that's good.
-And if my deduction is right,

1416
01:18:36,145 --> 01:18:37,645
you're gonna be honest
and tell me, okay?

1417
01:18:37,647 --> 01:18:42,016
Okay. Though I should mention that 
it is possible for any given text alert

1418
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:46,087
-to become randomly attached to...
-Happy birthday.

1419
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:51,759
Thank you, John, 
that's very kind of you.

1420
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:53,994
Never knew when
your birthday was.

1421
01:18:53,996 --> 01:18:55,162
Well, now you do.

1422
01:18:55,164 --> 01:18:58,065
-Seriously, we're not going to talk about this?
-Talk about what?

1423
01:18:58,067 --> 01:19:00,134
-I mean, how does it work?
-How does what work?

1424
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:04,405
You and the woman, do you go to a 
discreet harvester sometimes, is there

1425
01:19:04,407 --> 01:19:07,508
-nights of passion in High Wycombe?
-Oh, for god's sakes.

1426
01:19:07,510 --> 01:19:11,245
- I don't text her back.
- Why not?

1427
01:19:11,247 --> 01:19:13,948
You bloody moron!

1428
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:16,951
She's out there, she likes you, 
and she's alive,

1429
01:19:16,953 --> 01:19:20,354
and do you have the first idea
how lucky you are?

1430
01:19:20,356 --> 01:19:24,725
Yes she's a lunatic, she's a criminal, 
she's insanely dangerous,

1431
01:19:24,727 --> 01:19:26,460
trust you to fall
for a sociopath.

1432
01:19:26,462 --> 01:19:27,762
Oh, married an assassin.

1433
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:30,431
But she's, you know...

1434
01:19:30,433 --> 01:19:32,433
-What?
-Just text her back.

1435
01:19:32,435 --> 01:19:33,534
-Why?
-Because High Wycombe

1436
01:19:33,536 --> 01:19:37,338
is better than you are currently 
equipped to understand.

1437
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,573
I once caught a triple
poisoner in High Wycombe.

1438
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:41,142
That's only the beginning, mate.

1439
01:19:41,144 --> 01:19:44,311
As I think I've explain to
you many times before,

1440
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:45,179
romantic entanglement,

1441
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:46,580
while fulfilling for other people...

1442
01:19:46,582 --> 01:19:47,982
Would complete you
as a human being.

1443
01:19:47,984 --> 01:19:50,084
-That doesn't even mean anything.
-Just text her.

1444
01:19:50,086 --> 01:19:52,153
Phone her, do something
while there's still a chance.

1445
01:19:52,155 --> 01:19:53,487
Because that chance
doesn't last forever.

1446
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:56,457
Trust me, Sherlock,
it's gone before you know it.

1447
01:19:56,459 --> 01:19:59,093
Before you know it.

1448
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:07,268
She was wrong about me.

1449
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,336
Mary? How so?

1450
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:14,074
She thought that if you put
yourself in harm's way, I'd...

1451
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:15,242
I'd rescue you or something.

1452
01:20:15,244 --> 01:20:18,179
But I didn't,
not 'till she told me to.

1453
01:20:18,181 --> 01:20:20,648
And that's how this works,
that's what you're missing.

1454
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:24,051
She taught me to be the man
she already thought I was.

1455
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:25,052
Get yourself a piece of that.

1456
01:20:25,054 --> 01:20:26,487
Look at me, you are
doing yourself a disservice.

1457
01:20:26,489 --> 01:20:29,356
I have known many people in this world,
but made few friends,

1458
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:33,427
-and I can safely say...
-I cheated on her.

1459
01:20:35,230 --> 01:20:39,266
No clever comeback?
I cheated on you, Mary.

1460
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,569
It was a woman, on the bus,

1461
01:20:41,571 --> 01:20:47,241
and I had a plastic Daisy in my hair, 
I'd been playing with Rosie.

1462
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:51,145
And this girl just smiled at me.

1463
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,448
That's all it was,
it was a smile.

1464
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:56,317
We texted constantly.

1465
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:59,386
You want to know when?
Every time you left the room, that's when.

1466
01:20:59,388 --> 01:21:01,188
When you're feeding our daughter.

1467
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:05,092
When you were stopping her
from crying, that's when.

1468
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:11,198
That's all it was.

1469
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:13,701
Just texting.

1470
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,503
But I wanted more.

1471
01:21:17,105 --> 01:21:20,307
And you know something?
I still do.

1472
01:21:20,309 --> 01:21:22,309
I'm not the man
you thought I was.

1473
01:21:22,311 --> 01:21:23,444
I'm not that guy.

1474
01:21:23,446 --> 01:21:24,678
I never could be.

1475
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:27,314
But that's the point.

1476
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:33,020
That's the whole point.

1477
01:21:35,824 --> 01:21:38,492
Who you thought I was...

1478
01:21:39,361 --> 01:21:42,263
Is the man who I want to be.

1479
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:46,567
Well then,

1480
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:50,137
John Watson.

1481
01:21:55,510 --> 01:21:58,178
Get the hell on with it.

1482
01:22:15,697 --> 01:22:17,131
It's okay.

1483
01:22:17,133 --> 01:22:19,233
It's not okay.

1484
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:21,802
No.

1485
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:26,040
But it is what it is.

1486
01:22:32,047 --> 01:22:35,382
<i> So, Molly's gonna</i>
<i> meet us at this cake place.</i>

1487
01:22:35,384 --> 01:22:37,718
<i> It's your birthday,</i>
<i> cake is obligatory.</i>

1488
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:42,456
Well, I suppose a sugar high
is some sort of substitute.

1489
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:43,023
Behave.

1490
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:47,528
Right then. You know,
it's not my place to say, but,

1491
01:22:47,696 --> 01:22:50,197
it was just texting.

1492
01:22:50,398 --> 01:22:53,133
People text, even I text, her.

1493
01:22:53,135 --> 01:22:55,102
I mean, woman. Bad idea.

1494
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:58,105
Try not to, but,
you know, sometimes...

1495
01:22:58,573 --> 01:23:00,174
It's not a pleasant thought, John.

1496
01:23:00,176 --> 01:23:02,710
But I have this terrible
feeling from time to time

1497
01:23:02,712 --> 01:23:06,013
that we might all just be human.

1498
01:23:06,015 --> 01:23:08,048
-Even you?
-No.

1499
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:10,117
Even you.

1500
01:23:13,154 --> 01:23:15,055
-Cake?
-Cake.

1501
01:23:15,223 --> 01:23:16,590
Oh, erm...

1502
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:19,259
What. What is it?

1503
01:23:19,261 --> 01:23:21,295
What's wrong?

1504
01:23:22,230 --> 01:23:23,597
Seriously?

1505
01:23:23,599 --> 01:23:26,600
I'm Sherlock Holmes.
I wear the damn hat.

1506
01:23:29,404 --> 01:23:32,039
Isn't that right, Mary?

1507
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:43,617
You seem so much better, John.

1508
01:23:43,619 --> 01:23:46,086
Yeah, I am. I think I am.

1509
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:50,357
Not all day, not every day,
but, uh, you know.

1510
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:53,293
-It is what it is?
-Yeah.

1511
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:55,396
And Rosie?

1512
01:23:55,398 --> 01:23:56,730
Beautiful, perfect.

1513
01:23:56,732 --> 01:23:59,533
Unprecedented in the
history of children.

1514
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:03,704
-That's not my bias, that's scientific fact.
-Good.

1515
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:05,205
And Sherlock Holmes?

1516
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:05,739
Back to normal.

1517
01:24:05,741 --> 01:24:08,142
-Get out!
-She's possessed by the devil.

1518
01:24:08,144 --> 01:24:10,277
I swear my wife
is Channelling Satan!

1519
01:24:10,279 --> 01:24:11,779
Yes, boring, go away.

1520
01:24:11,781 --> 01:24:14,281
-I'm not Channelling Satan.
-Why not?

1521
01:24:14,283 --> 01:24:16,984
Given your immediate alternative.

1522
01:24:25,126 --> 01:24:26,193
What about his brother?

1523
01:24:26,195 --> 01:24:27,161
Mycroft? He's fine.

1524
01:24:27,163 --> 01:24:31,532
So, you're off now, 
I won't see you for a week?

1525
01:24:31,534 --> 01:24:33,767
Just spending it at home.

1526
01:24:33,769 --> 01:24:35,469
Unless she calls.

1527
01:24:35,471 --> 01:24:37,104
The PM.

1528
01:24:37,672 --> 01:24:40,074
-Here.
-What's this?

1529
01:24:40,076 --> 01:24:40,774
My number.

1530
01:24:40,776 --> 01:24:42,509
I already have your number.

1531
01:24:42,511 --> 01:24:43,710
My private number.

1532
01:24:43,712 --> 01:24:45,579
Why would I need that?

1533
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:46,580
I don't know.

1534
01:24:46,582 --> 01:24:49,249
Maybe you'd like a drink sometime.

1535
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:51,085
Of what?

1536
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:52,786
Up to you.

1537
01:24:53,188 --> 01:24:54,655
Call me.

1538
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:09,069
I mean obviously, normal and
fine are both relative terms

1539
01:25:09,071 --> 01:25:10,637
when it comes to
Sherlock and Mycroft.

1540
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:13,407
Obviously.

1541
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:23,650
She was real.

1542
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:34,194
But, I didn't mean Mycroft.
I mean the other one.

1543
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:35,162
Which other one?

1544
01:25:35,164 --> 01:25:37,297
You know, the secret one.

1545
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:39,199
Oh, that was just something...

1546
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:42,169
I said. I'm sure there's...

1547
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:47,307
How did you know about that,
i didn't tell you that.

1548
01:25:47,309 --> 01:25:49,576
-You must have done.
-I really didn't.

1549
01:25:49,578 --> 01:25:51,612
Well, maybe Sherlock told me.

1550
01:25:51,614 --> 01:25:56,683
Wait, you've met Sherlock
exactly once, in this room.

1551
01:25:56,685 --> 01:25:57,518
He was off his head.

1552
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:01,421
- Oh no, no. I met him before that.
- When?

1553
01:26:01,423 --> 01:26:04,224
We spent a night together.

1554
01:26:04,226 --> 01:26:05,759
It was lovely.

1555
01:26:06,227 --> 01:26:08,228
We had chips.

1556
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:17,638
You're not
what I expected, mr Holmes.

1557
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,473
You're...

1558
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:21,575
Nicer.

1559
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:35,989
Culverton gave me
faith's original note.

1560
01:26:35,991 --> 01:26:39,026
A mutual friend
put us in touch.

1561
01:26:39,028 --> 01:26:42,462
Did Sherlock ever tell
you about the note?

1562
01:26:42,464 --> 01:26:48,602
I added some deductions for Sherlock. 
He was quite good.

1563
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:53,273
But he didn't get the big one.

1564
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:08,755
In fairness though, he does
have excellent taste in chips.

1565
01:27:08,757 --> 01:27:10,290
-What's that?
-What's what?

1566
01:27:10,292 --> 01:27:12,659
The flower in your hair
is like I had on the bus.

1567
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:15,329
You looked very sweet.

1568
01:27:15,630 --> 01:27:17,497
But then...

1569
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,001
You have such nice eyes.

1570
01:27:21,003 --> 01:27:24,371
Amazing, the times a man doesn't
really look at your face.

1571
01:27:24,373 --> 01:27:29,443
Oh, you can hide behind a sexy smile
or a walking cane.

1572
01:27:29,445 --> 01:27:34,281
Or just be a therapist,
talking about you.

1573
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:35,515
All the time.

1574
01:27:35,517 --> 01:27:39,319
Oh, please don't go anywhere,
I'm sure the therapist who actually lives here

1575
01:27:39,321 --> 01:27:41,455
wouldn't want blood
on the carpet.

1576
01:27:41,457 --> 01:27:43,190
Oh, hang on. It's fine.

1577
01:27:43,192 --> 01:27:44,992
She's in a sack
in the airing cupboard.

1578
01:27:44,994 --> 01:27:48,328
-Who are you?
-Isn't it obvious?

1579
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:52,199
Haven't you guessed?

1580
01:27:52,201 --> 01:27:53,634
I'm Eurus.

1581
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:54,401
Eurus?

1582
01:27:54,403 --> 01:27:58,639
Silly name, isn't it? Greek.
Means the east wind.

1583
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:01,508
My parents loved silly names.

1584
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:04,011
Like Eurus,

1585
01:28:04,145 --> 01:28:05,746
or Mycroft,

1586
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,148
or Sherlock.

1587
01:28:08,150 --> 01:28:09,449
Oh, look at him.

1588
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:10,751
Didn't it ever occur to
you not even once,

1589
01:28:10,753 --> 01:28:16,523
that Sherlock's secret brother
might just be Sherlock's secret sister?

1590
01:28:18,359 --> 01:28:19,626
Oh.

1591
01:28:20,228 --> 01:28:23,030
He's making a funny face.

1592
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:26,166
I think I'll put a hole in it.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
