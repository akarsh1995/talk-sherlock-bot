mr magnussen please state your 
full name for the record 
charles augustus magnussen 
mr magnussen 
how would you describe your 
influence over the prime minister 
the british prime minister 
any of the british prime ministers 
you have known 
i never had the slightest 
influence over any of them 
why would i 
i notice you've had seven meetings 
at downing street this year 
why 
because i was invited 
can you recall the subjects 
under discussion 
not without being more indiscreet 
than i believe is appropriate 
do you think it right that 
a newspaper proprietor 
a private individual 
and in fact a foreign national 
should have such regular access 
to our prime minister 
i don't think it's wrong that 
a private individual should 
accept an invitation 
however you have my sincere 
apologies for being foreign 
that's not what i meant that is 
not in any way 
mr magnussen 
can you recall an occasion 
when your remarks could have 
influenced government policy 
or the prime minister's 
thinking in any way 
no 
are you sure 
i have an excellent memory 
your car is waiting outside 
see you tomorrow 
may i join you 
i don't think it's appropriate 
it isn't mr magnussen outside the 
inquiry we can have no contact 
no communication at all 
please don't do that 
in 1982 your husband corresponded 
with helen catherine driscoll 
that was before i knew him 
the letters were lively loving 
some would say explicit 
and currently in my possession 
will you please move your hand 
the touch of your body" 
i know what was in the letters 
she was 15 
she looked older 
oh she looked delicious 
we have photographs too 
the ones she sent him 
yum-yum 
he was unaware of her age 
he met her only 
once before the letters began 
when he discovered the truth 
he stopped immediately 
those are the facts 
facts are for history books 
i work in news 
your hand is sweating 
always i'm afraid 
i have a condition 
it's disgusting 
i'm used to it 
the whole world is wet to my touch 
i will call someone 
i will have you removed 
what is that 
claire de la lune 
a bit young for you isn't it 
you want to hit me now 
could you still 
little old lady now 
perhaps you should 
settle for calling someone 
well go on 
no 
because now there are consequences 
i have the letters 
and therefore i have you 
this is blackmail 
of course it isn't blackmail 
this is 
ownership 
you do not own me 
claire de la lune 
it never tastes like it smells 
does it 
lady smallwood's bill is on me 
see to it 
yes mr magnussen 
oh god oh 
you all right ma'am 
fine yes 
magnussen 
no-one stands up to him 
no-one dares no-one even tries 
there isn't a man or woman 
in england capable of stopping 
that disgusting creature

back into town turn around

seriously shezza though 
we're not going home we're going to 
bart's i'm calling molly why 
because sherlock holmes needs 
to pee in a jar 
well is he clean 
clean 
how dare you throw away the 
beautiful gifts you were born with 
and how dare you betray 
the love of your friends 
say you're sorry 
sorry your engagement's over though i'm 
fairly grateful for the lack of a ring 
stop it just stop it 
if you were anywhere near this 
kind of thing again 
you could have called 
you could have talked to me 
please do relax 
this is all for a case 
what kind of case would need 
you doing this 
i might as well ask you why you've 
started cycling to work 
no we're not playing this game 
quite recently i'd say 
you're very determined about it 
not interested i am ow 
oh sorry you moved 
but it is just a sprain 
yeah somebody hit me huh 
yeah just some guy 
yeah it was probably just 
an addict in need of a fix 
yes i think in a way it was 
is it his shirt i'm sorry 
well it's the creases isn't it 
the two creases down the front 
it's been recently folded 
but it's not new 
you must have dressed in a hurry 
this morning 
so all your shirts must be 
kept like that 
but why 
maybe cos you cycle to work 
every morning shower 
when you get there and then dress 
in the clothes you brought with you 
you keep your shirts folded 
ready to pack 
not bad 
and i further deduce 
because you've got a bit of chafing 
no he's always walked like that 
remind me what's your name again 
they call me the wig 
no they don't 
well they they call me wiggy 
nope 
bill bill wiggins 
nice observational skills billy 
ah finally 
finally what good news 
oh excellent news the best 
there's every chance that my drug 
habit might hit the newspapers 
the game is on 
excuse me for a second 
you've heard of charles augustus 
magnussen of course 
yeah owns some newspapers 
ones i don't read 
hang on weren't there other people 
mary's taking the boys home 
i'm taking you we did discuss it 
people were talking none of them 
were me i must have filtered 
i noticed i have to filter out 
a lot of witless babble 
i've got mrs hudson 
on semi-permanent mute 
what is my brother doing here 
so i'll just pay then shall i 
he's straightened the knocker 
he always corrects it it's ocd 
doesn't even know he's doing it 
why do you do that do what 
nothing 
well then sherlock 
back on the sauce 
what are you doing here 
i phoned him 
the siren call of old habits 
how very like uncle rudy 
though in many ways cross-dressing would have 
been a wiser path for you you phoned him 
of course i bloody phoned him 
of course he bloody did 
now save me a little time - 
where should we be looking 
mr holmes 
for god's sake 
anderson sorry sherlock 
it's for your own good 
oh that's him isn't it 
you said he'd be taller 
some members of your little fan 
club do be polite 
they're entirely trustworthy 
and even willing to search 
through the toxic waste dump that 
you are pleased to call a flat 
you're a celebrity these days 
sherlock 
you can't afford a drug habit 
it was blocking my view to the 
kitchen 
well it's good to be missed 
you were gone i saw an opportunity 
no you saw the kitchen 
what have you found so far 
clearly nothing 
there's nothing to find 
your bedroom door is shut 
you haven't been home all night 
so why would a man who has never 
knowingly closed a door without 
the direct orders of his mother 
bother to do so on this occasion 
ok stop just stop point made 
jesus sherlock 
i shall have to phone our parents 
of course in oklahoma 
it won't be the first time that 
your substance abuse 
has wreaked 
havoc with their line dancing 
this is not what you think 
this is for a case 
what case could possibly 
justify this 
magnussen 
charles augustus magnussen 
that name you think you may have 
just heard you were mistaken 
if you ever mention hearing that 
name in this room 
in this context 
i guarantee you on behalf 
of the british security services 
that materials will be found on 
your computer hard-drives resulting 
in your immediate incarceration 
don't reply just look frightened 
and scuttle 
i hope i won't have to 
threaten you as well 
well i think we'd both find 
that embarrassing 
magnussen is not your business 
oh you mean he's yours you may 
consider him under my protection 
i consider you under his thumb 
if you go against magnussen 
then you will find yourself 
going against me 
ok i'll let you know if i notice 
um what was i going to say 
oh yeah 
bye-bye 
unwise brother mine 
ohh ugh 
brother mine 
mycroft don't say another word 
just go 
he could snap you in two 
and right now 
i'm slightly worried that he might 
don't speak just leave 
oh 
er magnussen 
what time is it about eight 
i'll be meeting him in three hours 
i need a bath 
it's for a case you say yep 
what sort of case 
too big and dangerous for any sane 
individual to get involved in 
you trying to put me off god no 
trying to recruit you 
and stay out of my bedroom 
oh john hi how are you 
janine 
sorry not dressed 
has everybody gone 
i heard shouting 
yes they're gone 
god look at the time i'll be late 
it sounded like an argument 
was it mike mike 
mike yeah his brother mike 
they're always fighting 
mycroft 
do people actually call him that 
yeah huh 
oh could you be a love 
and put some coffee on 
sure right yeah 
thanks oh how is mary 
how's married life 
she's fine we're both fine yeah 
oh it's over there now 
where's sherl 
er he's just having a bath 
i'm sure he'll be out in a minute 
oh like he ever is yeah 
morning room for a little one 
morning 
ooh 
so it's just a guess but you've 
probably got some questions 
yeah one or two pretty much 
naturally 
you have a girlfriend yes i have 
now magnussen 
magnussen is like a shark 
it's the only way 
i can describe him 
have you ever been to the shark tank at the london 
aquarium john stood up close to the glass 
those floating flat faces 
those dead eyes that's what he is 
i've dealt with murderers 
psychopaths 
terrorists serial killers 
none of them can turn my stomach 
like charles augustus magnussen 
yes you have 
sorry what 
you have a girlfriend what yes 
yes i'm going out with janine 
i thought that was fairly obvious 
yes well yes 
you you you are 
in a relationship 
yes i am 
you and janine hmm 
yes me and janine 
care to elaborate 
well we're in a good place 
it's um 
very affirming 
you got that from a book 
everyone got that from a book 
ok you two bad boys 
behave yourselves 
you sherl you're going to have to 
tell me where you were last night 
working working of course 
i'm the only one who really knows 
what you're like remember 
well don't you go letting on 
i might just actually 
i haven't told mary about this 
i kind of wanted to surprise her 
yeah i think you probably will 
but we should have you two 
over for dinner really soon 
yeah my place though 
not the scuzz-dump 
great yeah 
dinner yeah 
i'd better dash it was 
brilliant to see you you too 
have a lovely day call me later 
i might do i might call you 
unless i meet someone prettier 
solve me a crime sherlock holmes 
you know magnussen 
as a newspaper owner 
but he is so much more than that 
he uses his power and wealth 
to gain information 
the more he acquires 
the greater his wealth and power 
and i'm not exaggerating when i say that he knows 
the critical pressure point on every person of note 
or influence in the whole of the 
western world and probably beyond 
he is the napoleon of blackmail 
and he has created an unassailable 
architecture of forbidden knowledge 
its name 
is appledore 
dinner sorry what dinner 
me and mary coming for dinner with 
wine and 
sitting 
seriously i have just told you that 
the western world is run 
from this house and you want to talk about 
dinner fine talk about the house 
it is the greatest repository 
of sensitive and dangerous 
information anywhere in the world 
the alexandrian library 
of secrets and scandals 
and none of it is on a computer 
he's smart computers can be hacked 
it's all on hard copy in vaults 
underneath that house 
and as long as it is 
the personal freedom of anyone 
you've ever met is a fantasy 
that was the doorbell 
couldn't you hear it 
it's in the fridge it kept ringing 
oh that's not a fault sherlock 
who is it 
mr holmes said you can go right up 
oh go ahead 
sir 
can i have a moment 
he's fine 
look i right 
i should probably tell you 
ok i 
there 
doesn't mean i'm not 
pleased to see you 
i can vouch for this man 
he is a doctor 
if you know who i am 
then you know who he is 
don't you mr magnussen 
i understood we were meeting 
at your office 
this is my office 
well it is now 
mr magnussen i have been 
asked to intercede with you 
by lady elizabeth smallwood 
on the matter 
of her husband's letters 
some time ago you put pressure 
on her concerning those letters 
she would like those letters back 
obviously the letters no longer 
have any practical use to you 
so with that in mind 
something i said 
no no i was reading 
there's rather a lot 
redbeard 
sorry sorry you were 
probably talking 
i 
i was trying to explain that i have 
been asked to act on behalf of 
bathroom 
along from the kitchen sir 
ok i've been asked to negotiate 
the return of those letters 
i am aware you do not make copies 
of sensitive documents 
is it like the rest of the flat 
sir the bathroom 
yes sir maybe not then 
am i acceptable to you 
as an intermediary 
lady elizabeth smallwood 
i like her 
mr magnussen 
am i acceptable to you 
as an intermediary 
she's english with a spine 
best thing about the english 
all standing around apologising 
you can do what you like here 
no-one's ever going to stop you 
a nation of herbivores 
i have interests 
all over the world but 
everything starts in england 
if it works here 
the united kingdom 
petri dish to the western world 
tell lady elizabeth i might need 
those letters so 
i'm keeping them 
goodbye 
anyway 
jesus 
did you notice the one 
extraordinary thing he did 
there was a moment that 
kind of stuck in the mind yeah 
exactly when he showed us 
the letters 
ok so he's brought 
the letters to london 
so no matter what he says 
he's ready to make a deal 
now magnussen only makes a deal once 
he's established a person's weaknesses 
the pressure point he calls it 
so clearly he believes 
i'm a drug addict 
and no serious threat 
and of course because he's in town tonight the 
letters will be in his safe in his london office 
while he's out to dinner with the marketing 
group of gb from seven till ten 
how do you know his schedule because 
i do i'll see you tonight 
i've got some shopping to do 
what's tonight 
i'll text instructions 
yeah i'll text you if i'm available 
you are i checked 
don't bring a gun 
why would i bring a gun 
or a knife or a tyre lever probably 
best not to do any arm-spraining 
but we'll see how the night goes are 
you just assuming i'm coming along 
time you got out of the house john you've put on 
it's actually 4lbs mary and i 
think seven see you later 
and breaking news now 
john garvie mp has been arrested 
today on charges of corruption 
this follows an investigation 
magnussen's office is on the top 
floor just below his private flat 
there are 14 layers of security 
between us and him 
two of which aren't even 
legal in this country 
want to know how we're going to break in is that 
what we're doing of course it's what we're doing 
magnussen's private lift 
goes straight to his penthouse 
and office only he uses it 
and only his keycard calls the lift 
if anyone else even tries 
security is automatically informed 
standard keycard for the building 
nicked it yesterday only gets us 
as far as the canteen 
here we go then if i was to use 
this card on that lift now 
what happens 
well the alarms would go off 
and you'd be dragged away 
by security exactly 
get taken to a small room somewhere 
and your head kicked in 
do we really need so much colour 
it passes the time 
but if i do this 
if you press a keycard against 
your mobile phone for long enough 
it corrupts the magnetic strip 
the card stops working 
it's a common problem never put 
your keycard with your phone 
what happens if i use the card now 
it still doesn't work 
but it doesn't read 
as the wrong card now 
it registers as corrupted 
but if it's corrupted how 
do they know it's not magnussen 
would they risk dragging him off 
probably not 
so what do they do 
what do they have to do 
check if it's him or not 
there's a camera at eye height 
to the right of the door 
a live picture of the card user 
is relayed directly 
to magnussen's personal staff 
in his office 
the only people trusted 
to make a positive id 
at this hour 
almost certainly his pa 
so how does that help us 
human error 
i've been shopping 
here we go then 
you realise you don't exactly 
look like magnussen 
which in this case is 
a considerable advantage 
sherlock you complete loon what are 
you doing hang on was that 
hi janine 
go on let me in 
i can't you know i can't 
don't be silly 
don't make me do it out here 
not in front of everyone 
do what in front of everyone 
you see as long as there's people there's 
always a weak spot that was janine 
yes of course it was 
she's magnussen's pa 
that's the whole point did you just get engaged to 
break into an office yeah stroke of luck meeting her 
at your wedding you can take 
some of the credit jesus 
sherlock she loves you 
yes like i said human error 
what are you going to do well not 
actually marry her obviously 
there's only so far you can go 
so what will you tell her 
well i'll tell her that our entire 
relationship was a ruse 
to break into her boss's office 
i imagine she'll want to stop 
seeing me at that point 
but you're the expert on women 
so where did she go 
that's a bit rude 
i just proposed to her 
sherlock 
did she faint 
do they really do that 
it's a blow to the head 
she's breathing 
janine 
another in here 
security 
does he need help 
ex-con white supremacist 
by the tattoos so who cares 
stick with janine 
janine focus on my voice 
can you hear me 
hey they must still be here 
so is magnussen 
his seat's still warm 
he should be at dinner 
but he's still in the building 
upstairs we should call the police 
during our own burglary 
you're really not a natural 
at this are you 
no wait sssh 
perfume and not janine's 
claire de la lune 
why do i know it 
mary wears it no not mary 
somebody else 
sherlock 
what would your husband think 
your lovely husband 
upright and honourable 
so english what would 
he say to you now 
no no 
you're doing this to protect 
him from the truth 
well is this the protection 
he would want 
additionally if you're 
going to commit murder 
you might consider changing 
your perfume lady smallwood 
sorry who 
that's not lady smallwood 
mr holmes 
is john with you he's um 
is john here 
he's downstairs 
so what do you do now 
kill us both 
mary whatever he's got on you 
let me help 
oh sherlock if you take one more 
step i swear i will kill you 
no mrs watson 
you won't 
i'm sorry sherlock 
i truly am 
mary 
it's not like it is in the movies 
there's not a great big spurt of 
blood and you go flying backwards 
the impact isn't spread 
over a wide area 
it's tightly focused so there's 
little or no energy transfer 
you stay still 
and the bullet pushes through 
you're almost certainly going 
to die so we need to focus 
i said "focus" 
it's all well and clever 
having a mind palace 
but you've only three seconds 
of consciousness left to use it 
so come on 
what's going to kill you 
blood loss exactly 
so it's all about one thing now - 
forwards or backwards 
we need to decide which way 
you're going to fall 
one hole or two sorry 
is the bullet still inside you 
or is there an exit wound 
it'll depend on the gun 
that one i think 
or that one 
oh for god's sake sherlock 
it doesn't matter about the gun 
don't be stupid 
you always were so stupid 
such a disappointment 
i'm not stupid 
you're a very stupid little boy 
mummy and daddy are very cross 
because it doesn't matter 
about the gun 
why not 
you saw the whole room 
when you entered it 
what was directly behind you 
when you were murdered 
i've not been murdered yet 
balance of probability 
little brother 
if the bullet had passed through 
you what would you have heard 
the mirror shattering 
you didn't therefore 
the bullet's still inside me 
so we need to take him 
down backwards 
i agree sherlock 
you need to fall on your back 
right now the bullet is 
the cork in a bottle 
the bullet itself is blocking 
most of the blood flow 
but any pressure or impact on the 
entrance wound could dislodge it 
plus on your back gravity's 
working for us 
fall 
now 
what the hell is that 
what's happening 
you're going into shock it's the 
next thing that's going to kill you 
what do i do don't go 
into shock obviously 
must be something in this ridiculous 
memory palace of yours 
that can calm you down 
find it 
the east wind is coming sherlock 
it's coming to get you 
find it 
hello redbeard here boy 
come on come to me 
it's ok it's all right 
come on 
it's me it's me 
come on 
good boy clever boy 
good boy 
hello redbeard they're putting 
me down too now 
it's no fun is it 
redbeard 
that was shock you're going 
to feel the pain 
there's a hole ripped through you 
massive internal bleeding 
you have to control the pain 
control control control 
you 
you never felt pain did you 
why did you never feel pain 
you always feel it sherlock 
but you don't have to fear it 
pain 
it's all good 
sherlock sherlock can you hear me 
what happened 
he got shot 
jesus 
sherlock 
oh my 
who shot him 
do you require' 
sherlock 
we're losing you sherlock 
come on sherlock 
just die why can't you 
one little push 
and off you pop 
you're going to love being dead 
sherlock no-one ever bothers you 
mrs hudson will cry 
and mummy and daddy will cry 
and the woman will cry and john 
will cry buckets and buckets 
it's him that i worry about 
the most that wife 
you're letting him down sherlock 
john watson is definitely in danger 
oh you're not getting 
better are you 
was it something i said huh 
sherlock 
mary hey 
he's only bloody woken up 
he's pulled through really 
yeah seriously you 
mrs watson you're in big trouble 
really why

going to tell him 
i'm buying a cottage 
i've made a lot of money 
out of you mister 
nothing hits the spot 
like revenge with profits 
you didn't give those stories 
to magnussen did you 
god no one of his rivals 
he was spitting 
hmm 
sherlock holmes you are 
a back-stabbing heartless 
manipulative bastard 
and you as it turns out 
are a grasping opportunistic 
publicity-hungry tabloid whore 
so we're good then 
yeah of course 
where's the cottage sussex downs 
nice it's gorgeous 
there's beehives 
but i'm getting rid of those 
oh it hurts does it 
probably want to restart 
your morphine 
i might have fiddled with the taps 
how much more revenge are you going 
to need just the occasional top-up 
dream come true for you this place 
they actually attach 
the drugs to you 
not good for working 
you won't be working 
for a while sherl 
you lied to me 
you lied and lied 
i exploited the fact 
of our connection 
when 
just once would have been nice 
oh 
i was waiting till we got married 
that was never going to happen 
got to go 
i'm not supposed 
to keep you talking 
and also i have an interview 
with the one show 
and i haven't made it up yet 
just one thing 
you shouldn't have lied to me 
i know what kind of man you are 
but we could have been friends 
i'll give your love 
to john and mary 
you don't tell him 
you don't tell john 
so 
mary watson 
i don't know how much sense 
you'll get out of him 
he's drugged up 
so he's pretty much babbling 
oh they won't let you use 
that in here you know 
no i'm not going to use the phone 
i just want to take a video 
oh jesus 
so where would he go 
oh christ knows 
try finding sherlock in london 
he's got three known bolt-holes 
parliament hill camden lock 
and dagmar court 
five known bolt holes 
there's the blind greenhouse 
in kew gardens 
and the leaning tomb 
in hampstead cemetery 
just the spare bedroom 
well my bedroom 
we agreed he needs the space 
behind the clock face of big ben 
i think he was probably joking 
no i don't think so 
leinster gardens it's his number 
one bolt hole top top secret 
he only knows about it 
cos he stalked him one night 
followed followed yeah 
he knew who shot him 
the bullet wound was here 
so he was facing whoever it was 
so why not tell us because he's 
tracking them down himself 
or protecting them 
protecting the shooter why 
well protecting someone then 
but why would he care 
he's sherlock who would he 
bother protecting 
call me if you hear anything 
don't hold out on me john 
call me ok yeah yeah right 
good night then bye then 
john need a cuppa 
mrs hudson why does sherlock think 
that i'll be moving back in here 
oh yes he's put your chair 
back again hasn't he 
that's nice it looks much better 
john what's wrong tell me john 
that's your phone isn't it 
it's sherlock john sherlock 
john you have to answer it 
spare any change love no 
oh come on love 
don't be like all the rest 
rule one of looking 
for sherlock holmes he finds you 
you're working for sherlock now 
keeps me off the streets 
doesn't it well no 
where are you 
well what am i looking for 
gardens hidden in plain sight 
here for years and never see it 
it will take you less than a minute 
look at the houses' 
how did you know i'd come here 
no-one else would bother with' 
huh i thought i was being clever 
mary i was relying on that 
for you to find' 
ohh 
but what am i looking at 
painted windows 
make way for the london underground 
section of the house remains' 
a touch of drama 
do you own this place 
the clarence house cannibal 
fortunately i had a straight flush 
what do you want sherlock 
in october 1972 
cemetery where five years ago 
birth and thereafter her identity 
friends from before that date' 
need to work on your half of the 
church mary looking a bit thin 
oh orphan's lot 
friends that's all i have 
known to the kinds of people 
a skip code on sight' 
at first i thought it was just 
a bible thing spam but it's not 
it's a skip code 
retentive memories' 
how can you not remember which room 
you remember everything 
i have to delete something 207 
you were very slow 
how badly do you want to find out 
my body would be found in a building 
projected on the front of it 
somewhere with that 
a little bit bored by now' 
may i see 
huh it's a dummy 
well i suppose that was a fairly 
obvious trick 
and yet 
over a distance of six feet 
you failed to make a kill shot 
enough to hospitalise me 
not enough to kill me 
that wasn't a miss 
that was surgery 
i'll take the case what case 
yours why didn't you come to me 
in the first place 
because john can't ever know that 
i lied to him 
it would break him 
and i would lose him forever 
and sherlock i will never 
let that happen 
please understand 
there is nothing in this world i 
would not do to stop that happening 
sorry 
not that obvious a trick 
now talk and sort it out 
and do it quickly 
angels sing" 
oh dear god it's only two o'clock 
it's been christmas day 
for at least a week now 
how can it only be two o'clock 
i'm in agony 
mikey is this your laptop 
upon which depends the security 
of the free world yes 
and you've got potatoes on it 
you shouldn't leave it lying around 
if it's so important 
why are we doing this 
we never do this 
we are here because sherlock 
is home from hospital 
and we are all very happy 
am i happy too i haven't checked 
behave mike 
mycroft is the name you gave me 
if you could possibly struggle all 
the way to the end mrs holmes 
oh thank you dear i'm not 
absolutely sure why you're here 
i invited him 
i'm his protege mrs holmes 
when he dies 
i get all his stuff and his job 
no oh well i help out a bit 
closer 
if he does get murdered or 
something 
probably stop talking now ok 
lovely when you 
bring your friends round() 
stop it you 
somebody's put a bullet in my boy 
if i ever find out who 
i shall turn absolutely monstrous 
this was for mary 
i'll be back in a minute 
ah mary there you are 
cup of tea if father starts 
making little humming noises 
just give him a little poke 
that usually does it 
did you write this 
oh that silly old thing 
you mustn't read that 
mathematics must seem terribly 
fatuous now 
no humming you 
complete flake my wife but happens 
to be a genius 
she was a mathematician 
gave it all up for children i could 
never bear to argue with her 
i'm something of a moron myself 
but she's unbelievably hot 
oh my god you're the sane one 
aren't you 
aren't you 
oh sorry i just er 
oh you two need a moment 
if you don't mind 
no course not i'll go and see if 
i can help with 
something or another 
those two they all right 
well you know 
they've had their ups and downs 
baker street now 
john mary 
oh sherlock oh good gracious 
you look terrible 
get me some morphine 
from your kitchen i've run out 
i don't have any morphine then what 
exactly is the point of you 
what is going on 
bloody good question 
the watsons are about to have a domestic and fairly 
quickly i hope because we've got work to do 
no i have a better question - 
is everyone i have ever met 
a psychopath 
yes 
good that we've settled that 
now we shut up 
and stay shut up 
because this is not funny 
not this time 
i didn't say it was funny you 
what have i ever done hmm 
my whole life to deserve you 
everything 
sherlock i've told you shut up 
no i mean it - 
seriously everything 
everything you've ever done 
is what you did 
sherlock one more word 
and you will not need morphine 
you were a doctor who went to war 
you're a man who couldn't stay in 
the suburbs for more than a month 
without storming a crack den 
beating up a junkie 
your best friend is a 
sociopath who solves crimes 
as an alternative to getting high 
that's me by the way hello 
even the landlady used to 
run a drug cartel 
it was my husband's cartel 
i was just typing 
and exotic dancing 
sherlock holmes 
if you've been youtubing 
john you are addicted to 
a certain lifestyle 
you are abnormally attracted to 
dangerous situations and people 
so is it truly such a surprise 
that the woman you fall in love with 
conforms to that pattern 
but she wasn't supposed to 
be like that 
why is she like that 
because you chose her 
why is everything always 
oh neighbours 
john listen be calm and answer me 
what is she 
my lying wife no what is she 
and the woman who is carrying my child who 
has lied to me since the day i met her 
no not in this flat 
not in this room 
right here right now what is she 
ok 
your way 
always your way 
sit 
why 
because that's where they sit 
the people who come in here 
with their stories 
they're the clients 
that's all you are now mary 
you're a client 
this is where you sit and talk 
and this is where we sit and listen 
then we decide 
if we want you or not 
so are you ok 
oh are we doing conversation today 
it really is christmas() 
now 
seriously months of silence 
and we're going to do this now 
agra what's that 
er my initials 
everything about who 
i was is on there 
if you love me 
don't read it in front of me 
why 
because you won't love me 
when you've finished 
and i don't want to see that happen 
how much do you know already 
by your skill set you are or were 
an intelligence agent 
your accent is currently english 
but i suspect you are not 
you're on the run from something 
you've used your skills 
to disappear 
magnussen knows your secret which 
is why you were going to kill him 
and i assume you befriended 
janine in order to get close to him 
oh you can talk 
oh look at you two 
you should have got married 
the stuff magnussen has on me 
i would go to prison for the rest of 
my life 
so you were going to kill him people 
like magnussen should be killed 
that's why there are people like me 
perfect 
so that's what you were an assassin 
how could i not see that 
you did see that 
and you married me 
because he's right 
it's what you like 
so mary any documents that 
magnussen has 
concerning yourself 
you want extracted and returned 
why would you help me 
because you saved my life 
sorry-sorry what 
when i happened on you 
and magnussen 
more specifically 
you had a witness 
what do you do now 
kill both of us 
simple kill us both and leave' 
however 
sentiment got the better of you 
to incapacitate me 
more time to negotiate my silence' 
of course 
you couldn't shoot magnussen 
on the night both of us 
broke into the building 
your own husband would 
become a suspect so 
use the fact of your involvement' 
rather than sharing the information 
with the police as is his mo 
and then you left the way you came 
have i missed anything 
how did she save your life 
she phoned the ambulance 
i phoned the ambulance 
she phoned first 
which service do you require' 
you didn't find me 
for another five minutes 
left to you i would have died 
the average arrival 
time for a london ambulance is 
did somebody call an ambulance 
eight minutes did you bring any 
morphine i asked on the phone 
we were told there was a shooting 
there was last week 
but i believe i'm bleeding 
internally 
my pulse is very erratic you may need 
to restart my heart on the way 
jesus sherlock come on sherlock 
argh 
john john 
magnussen is all that matters now 
you can trust mary - 
she saved my life 
she shot you 
mixed messages i grant you that 
argh 
sherlock sherlock take him 
got him yeah 
so have you read it 
would you come here a moment 
no tell me have you 
just come here 
no i'm fine 
i've thought long and hard 
about what i want to say to you 
these are prepared words mary 
i've chosen these words with care 
ok 
the problems of your past 
are your business 
the problems of your future 
are my privilege 
it's all i have to say 
it's all i need to know 
no i didn't read it 
you don't even know my name 
is "mary watson" good enough for you 
yes oh my god yes 
then it's good enough for me too 
all this does not mean that i'm not 
still basically pissed off with you 
hmm i know i know 
i am very pissed off 
and it will come out now and then 
i know i know i know 
you can mow the sodding 
lawn from now on 
i do mow the lawn i do it loads 
you really don't 
i choose the baby's name 
not a chance ok 
i'm glad you've given up on the 
magnussen business are you 
i'm still curious though he's 
hardly your usual kind of puzzle 
why do you hate him 
because he attacks people 
who are different 
and preys on their secrets 
why don't you 
he never causes too much damage 
to anyone important 
he's far too intelligent for that 
he's a businessman that's all 
and occasionally useful to us 
a necessary evil 
not a dragon for you to slay 
a dragon-slayer 
is that what you think of me 
no it's what you think of yourself 
are you two smoking 
no it was mycroft 
i have by the way a job offer 
i should like you to decline 
i decline your kind offer 
i shall pass on your regrets 
what was it mi6 they want to 
place you back into eastern europe 
an undercover assignment 
that would prove fatal to you in 
i think about six months 
then why don't you want me 
to take it 
it's tempting but on balance you 
have more utility closer to home 
utility how do i have utility 
here be dragons 
this isn't agreeing with me 
i'm going in 
you need low tar 
you still smoke like a beginner 
also 
what the hell am 
i supposed to say to that 
merry christmas you hate christmas 
yes perhaps there was 
something in the punch 
clearly go and have some more 
so you realise that sherlock got us out 
here to see his mum and dad for a reason 
his lovely mum and dad a fine 
example of married life i get that 
that is the thing with sherlock 
it's always the unexpected 
oi oi mary 
jesus christ mary sit down 
mary can you hear me 
don't drink mary's tea 
or the punch 
sherlock 
did you just drug my pregnant wife 
don't worry 
wiggins is an excellent chemist 
i calculated your wife's dose 
myself won't affect the little one 
i'll keep an eye on her 
he'll monitor their recovery 
it's more or less his day job 
what the hell have you done 
a deal with the devil 
shouldn't you be in hospital 
i am in hospital 
this is the canteen 
is it in my opinion yes 
have a seat 
thank you 
i've been thinking about you 
i've been thinking about you 
really 
i want to see appledore 
where you keep all the secrets 
all the files 
everything you've got on everyone 
i want you to invite me 
what makes you think 
i'd be so careless 
oh i think you're a lot more 
careless than you let on 
am i 
it's the dead-eyed stare 
that gives it away 
except it's not dead-eyed is it 
you're reading 
portable appledore 
how does it work 
built-in flash drive 4g wireless 
they're just ordinary spectacles 
yes they are 
you underestimate me mr holmes 
impress me then show me appledore 
everything is available for a price 
are you making me an offer 
a christmas present 
and what are you giving me 
for christmas mr holmes 
my brother 
oh jesus 
sherlock please tell me you haven't 
just gone out of your mind 
i'd rather keep you guessing 
ah there's our lift 
coming 
where 
you want your wife to be safe 
of course i do 
good because this is going to be 
incredibly dangerous 
one false move and we'll have betrayed the 
security of the united kingdom and be in prison 
for high treason magnussen is the most 
dangerous man we've ever encountered 
and the odds are 
comprehensively stacked against us 
but it's christmas i feel the same 
oh you mean it's actually christmas 
did you bring your gun as i suggested 
why would i bring my gun to your parents' house 
for christmas dinner is it in your coat yes 
off we go then where are we going 
appledore 
i would offer you a drink 
but it's very rare and expensive 
oh it was you 
yes of course 
very hard to find a pressure 
point on you mr holmes 
the drugs thing 
i never believed for a moment 
anyway you wouldn't care 
if it was exposed would you 
but look how you 
care about john watson 
your damsel in distress 
you put me in a fire for leverage 
oh i would never let you burn 
dr watson 
i had people standing by 
i'm not a murderer 
unlike your wife 
let me explain how leverage works 
dr watson 
for those who understand 
these things 
mycroft holmes is the most powerful 
man in the country 
well apart from me 
mycroft's pressure point is his 
junkie detective brother sherlock 
sherlock's pressure point 
is his best friend john watson 
john watson's pressure 
point is his wife 
i own john watson's wife 
i own mycroft 
he's what i'm getting for christmas 
it's an exchange not a gift 
forgive me but 
i already seem to have it 
it's password protected 
in return for the password 
you will give me any material 
in your possession pertaining to the 
woman i know as mary watson 
oh she's bad that one 
so many dead people 
you should see what i've seen 
i don't need to see it 
you might enjoy it though 
i enjoy it 
then why don't you show us 
show you appledore 
the secret vaults 
is that what you want 
i want everything you've 
got on mary 
you know i honestly expected 
something good 
oh i think you'll find the contents of 
that laptop include a gps locator 
by now your brother will 
have noticed the theft 
and the security services will be 
converging on this house 
having arrived they'll find 
top-secret information in my hands 
and they have every justification 
to search my vaults 
they will discover further 
information of this kind 
and i will be imprisoned 
you would be exonerated and restored 
to your smelly little apartment 
to solve crimes with 
mr and mrs psychopath 
mycroft has been looking for this 
opportunity for a long time 
he'll be a very very proud 
big brother 
the fact that you know it's going to 
happen isn't going to stop it 
then why am i smiling ask me 
why are you smiling 
because sherlock holmes has made 
one enormous mistake 
which will destroy 
the lives of everyone he loves 
and everything he holds dear 
let me show you 
the appledore vaults 
the entrance to my vaults 
this is where i keep you all 
ok so where are the vaults then 
vaults what vaults there are no 
vaults beneath this building 
they're all in here 
the appledore vaults 
are my mind palace 
you know about mind palaces 
don't you sherlock 
how to store information so you 
never forget it by picturing it 
i just sit here i close my eyes 
and down i go to my vaults 
i can go anywhere inside my vaults 
my memories 
i'll look at the files 
on mrs watson 
hmm 
oh this is one of my favourites 
oh it's so exciting 
all those wet jobs for the cia 
ooh she's gone a bit freelance now 
bad girl 
oh she's so wicked 
i can really see why you like her 
you see 
so there are no documents you don't 
actually have anything here 
oh sometimes 
i send out for something 
if i really need it 
but mostly i just remember it all 
i don't understand 
you should have that on a t-shirt 
you just remember it all 
it's all about knowledge 
everything is knowing is owning 
but if you just know it 
then you don't have proof 
proof what would i need proof for 
i'm in news you moron 
i don't have to prove it 
i just have to print it 
speaking of news 
you'll both be heavily 
featured tomorrow 
trying to sell state secrets to me 
tut tut 
let's go outside 
they'll be here shortly 
can't wait to see you arrested 
sherlock do we have a plan 
sherlock 
they're taking their time 
aren't they 
i still don't understand 
and there's the back of the t-shirt 
you just know things - 
how does that work 
i just love your little soldier 
face i'd like to punch it 
bring it over here a minute 
come on for mary 
bring me your face 
lean forward a bit 
and stick your face out 
please 
now can i flick it 
look at me can i flick your face 
i just love doing this 
i could do it all day 
well it works like this john 
i know who mary hurt and killed 
i know where to find 
people who hate her 
i know where they live 
i know their phone numbers 
all in my mind palace all of it 
i could phone them right now 
and tear your whole life down 
unless you let me flick your face 
this is what i do to people 
this is what i do to 
whole countries 
just because i know 
can i do your eye now 
see if you can keep it open hmm 
come on for mary keep it open 
sherlock 
let him i'm sorry just let him 
hmm come on eye open 
it's difficult isn't it 
janine managed to once 
she makes the funniest noises 
sherlock holmes and john watson 
stand away from that man 
here we go mr holmes 
to clarify appledore's vaults only 
exist in your mind 
nowhere else just there 
they're not real 
they never have been 
sherlock holmes and john watson 
step away 
it's fine they're harmless 
i repeat target is not armed' 
sherlock what do we do 
nothing there is 
nothing to be done 
oh i'm not a villain 
i have no evil plan 
i'm a businessman acquiring assets 
you happen to be one of them 
sorry no chance for you to be 
a hero this time mr holmes 
sherlock holmes and john watson 
stand away from that man do it now 
oh do your research 
i'm not a hero 
i'm a high-functioning sociopath 
merry christmas 
get away from me 
john stay well back 
christ sherlock 
don't fire do not 
fire on sherlock holmes 
do not fire 
oh christ sherlock 
give my love to mary 
tell her she's safe now 
oh sherlock 
what have you done 
as my colleague is 
fond of remarking 
this country sometimes needs 
a blunt instrument 
equally 
it sometimes needs a dagger 
a scalpel wielded with precision 
and without remorse 
there will always come a time 
when we need sherlock holmes 
if this is some expression 
of familial sentiment 
don't be absurd 
i am not given to 
outbursts of brotherly compassion 
you know what 
happened to the other one 
in any event there is no prison in 
which we could incarcerate sherlock 
without causing a riot 
on a daily basis 
the alternative however 
would require your approval 
hardly merciful mr holmes 
regrettably lady smallwood 
my brother is a murderer 
you will look after him for me 
won't you 
hmm don't worry 
i'll keep him in trouble 
that's my girl 
since this is likely to be the last 
conversation i'll have with john watson 
would you mind if we took a moment 
so here we are 
william sherlock scott holmes 
sorry 
that's the whole of it 
if you're looking for baby names 
no we've had a scan 
we're pretty sure it's a girl 
oh ok 
yeah 
you know actually i can't 
think of a single thing to say 
no neither can i 
the game is over 
the game is never over john 
but there may be some 
new players now 
that's ok the east wind takes us 
all in the end what's that 
it's a story my brother told me 
when we were kids 
the east wind is a terrifying force 
that lays waste to all in its path 
it seeks out the unworthy 
and plucks them from the earth 
that was generally me 
nice() 
he's a rubbish big brother 
so what about you then 
where are you actually going now 
oh some undercover 
work in eastern europe 
for how long 
six months my brother estimates 
he's never wrong 
and then what 
who knows 
john there's something i should 
say i've meant to say always 
and i never have 
since it's unlikely we'll ever meet 
again i might as well say it now 
sherlock is actually a girl's name 
it's not 
it was worth a try 
we're not naming our daughter 
after you 
oh i think it could work 
to the very best of times john 
this looks good 
ooh he missed it' 
oi there's something wrong with the telly 
there's something wrong with the telly mate 
who's that 
did you miss me 
did you miss me did you miss me 
did you miss me did you miss me 
how is this possible 
we don't know but it's on every 
screen in the country 
every screen simultaneously 
has the prime minister been told 
and mycroft 
but that's not possible that is 
simply not possible 
what's happened 
sir it's your brother 
mycroft 
how's the exile going' 
i've only been gone four minutes 
well i certainly hope you've 
learnt your lesson 
oh for god's sake 
make up your mind 
who needs me this time 
did you miss me did you miss me 
did you miss me did you miss me' 
england 
but he's dead i mean you told me 
he was dead moriarty 
absolutely blew his own brains out 
so how can he be back 
well if he is 
he'd better wrap up warm 
there's an east wind coming 
miss me

saying i weren't a real man 
wasn't a real man 
what 
it's not "weren't" it's "wasn't" 
oh

wellthen i don't know 
how it happened 
but suddenly 
there's a knife in my hands 
so i know how to handle knives 
he learned us how to cut up a beast 
taught

taught you how to cut up a beast 
yeah well then i done it

over and over and over and i looked 
down and she weren't

god help me 
i dunno how it happened 
but it was an accident i swear 
you've got to help me mr holmes 
everyone says you're the best 
without you

don't know what's got into 
the criminal classes 
good job i'm not one of them 
so you take it out on the wall 
the wall had it coming 
what about that russian case 
belarus open and shut domestic 
murder not worth my time 
oh shame() 
anything in i'm starving 
oh f 
there's a head 
a severed head

yes a bloody head well where else 
could i put it

the taxi driver case 
eryes 
a study in pink 
nice 
well you know pink lady pink case 
pink phone there was a lot of pink 
did you like it 
umno why not 
i thought you'd be flattered 
flattered "sherlock sees through 
everything and everyone in seconds 
is how spectacularly ignorant he is 
i didn't mean that 
oh you meant "spectacularly 
ignorant" in a nice way() 
look it doesn't matter to me 
who's prime minister or i know 
whether the earth goes round the sun 
that again it's not important 
not impor 
it's primary school stuff 
how can you not know that well 
if i ever did i've deleted it 
deleted it 
listen this is my hard drive 
and it only makes sense 
to put things in there 
that are useful really useful 
ordinary people fill their heads 
with all kinds of rubbish 
that makes it hard to get at 
the stuff that matters do you see 
but it's the solar system 
oh hell what does that matter 
so we go round the sun 
if we went round the moon 
or round and round the garden 
like a teddy bear 
it wouldn't make any difference 
all that matters to me is the work 
without that my brain rots 
put that in your blog 
or better still stop inflicting 
your opinions on the world 
door opens and shuts 
where are you going 
out i need some air 
oh sorry love sorry

andrew west known as westie 
to his friends civil servant 
found dead on the tracks 
at battersea station this morning 
with his head smashed in 
jumped in front of a train 
seems the logical assumption 
but 
but 
well you wouldn't be here 
if it was just an accident 
hah 
the mod is working on a new missile 
defence system the bruce-partington 
program it's called 
the plans for it 
were on a memory stick 
that wasn't very clever 
it's not the only copy oh 
but it is secret 
and missing 
top secret 
very we think west 
must have taken the memory stick 
we can't risk it falling 
into the wrong hands 
you've got to find those plans 
sherlock 
don't make me order you 
i'd like to see you try 
think it over 
goodbye john 
mm 
see you very soon 
repeats rapid phrase 
footsteps fade 
why did you lie 
door shuts 
you've got nothing on 
not a single case 
that's why the wall took a pounding 
why did you tell your brother 
you were busy why shouldn't i 
oh 
nice 
sibling rivalry 
now we're getting somewhere 
mobile phone rings 
sherlock holmes 
of course how could i refuse 
lestrade - i've been summoned 
coming 
if you want me to of course 
i'd be lost without my blogger 
don't you' 
the surprising ones 
obviously 
you'll love this that explosion 
gas leak yes no 
no no made to look like one 
what 
hardly anything left of the place 
except a strongbox 
a very strong box 
and inside it was this 
you haven't opened it 
it's addressed to you isn't it 
we've x-rayed it it's not 
booby-trapped how reassuring 
nice stationery 
bohemian 
what 
from the czech republic 
no fingerprints 
no 
she used a fountain pen 
parker duofold iridium nib 
she 
obviously 
obviously 
but that that's the phone 
the pink phone 
what from the study in pink 
obviously it's not the same phone 
but it's supposed to look like 
of course we all do 
do you really not know that 
the earth goes round the sun 
she sniggers 
it isn't the same phone 
this one's brand-new 
someone's taken trouble to make it 
look the same which means your blog 
has a far wider readership 
five greenwich time signal pips 
was that it 
no that's not it 
phone beeps 
what the hell 
are we supposed to make of that 
an estate agent's photo 
and the bloody greenwich pips 
it's a warning 
a warning 
some secret societies 
used to send dried melon seeds 
orange pips things like that - 
five pips 
they're warning us 
it's going to happen again 
i've seen this place before 
hang on 
what's going to happen again 
boom 
mrs hudson 
you had a look didn't you 
when you first came 
to see about your flat 
the door's been opened recently 
no can't be that's the only key 
i can't get anyone interested 
in this flat 
it's the damp i expect - 
that's the curse of basements 
i'd a place once when i was first 
married mould all up the wall 
oh dear me 
shoes 
he's a bomber remember 
mobile phone rings 
softly: hello 
ragged breathing over phone 
woman: 'h-hellosexy' 
who's this 
woman sobs 
who's talking why are you crying 
woman cries 
and thisstupid bitch 
is reading it out 
the curtain rises 
what 
nothing no what did you mean 
i've been expecting this 
for some time 
sobbing: '12 hours to solve' 
or i'm going to be 
so who do you suppose it was 
hmm 
woman on the phone - 
the crying woman 
oh she doesn't matter 
she's just a hostage no lead there 
i wasn't thinking about leads you're 
not going to be much use to her 
are they trying to trace it - 
trace the call 
bomber's too smart for that 
mobile beeps

he cancel his dental appointment 
his what 
mycroft never texts if he can talk 
andrew west stole the missile plans 
tried to sell them 
got his head smashed in 
end of story 
the only mystery is why my brother 
is so determined to bore me when 
somebody is being so interesting 
try and remember 
there's a woman who might die 
what for there's hospitals 
full of people dying doctor 
why don't you go and cry 
by their bedside 
and see what good it does them 
computer beeps

we're together 
domestic bliss must suit you molly 
you've put on 3lb 
since i last saw you 
two-and-a-half no three 
sherlock 
he's not gay 
why do you have to spoil he's 
not with that level of grooming 
because he puts product in his 
hair i put product in my hair 
you wash your hair 
there's a difference 
tinted eyelashes signs of taurine 
cream around the frown lines 
those tired clubber's eyes 
then there's his underwear 
his underwear 
visible above the waistline 
very particular brand 
plus the suggestive fact that he 
left his number under this dish 
i'd say you'd better break it off 
now and save yourself the pain 
door opens 
charming well done() 
just saving her time 
isn't that kinder 
kinder no no sherlock 
that wasn't kind 
go on then 
hm 
you know what i do off you go 
oh no 
go on 
i'm not going to let you humiliate me 
while i an outside eye 
a second opinion - it's very useful 
to me yeah right() really 
fine 
clears throat 
oh they're just a pair of sh 
trainers good 
um 
they're in good nick 
i'd say they were pretty new 
except the sole has been well worn 
so the owner must have had them 
for a while 
er very '80s 
probably one of those retro designs 
you're on sparkling form 
what else 
they're quite big a man's 
but 
but there's traces of a name 
inside in felt-tip 
adults don't write their names 
inside their shoes 
so these belong to a kid 
excellent what else 
er 
that's it 
that's it 
how did i do 
well john 
really well 
i mean you missed almost everything 
of importance but you know 
the owner loved these 
scrubbed them clean 
whitened them changed the laces 
threeno four times 
there are traces of flaky skin where 
his fingers have come into contact 
with them so he had eczema 
the shoes are more worn on the 
inner side so he had weak arches 
british-made 20 years old 
they're original 
limited edition - 
two blue stripes 1989 
there's still mud on them 
they look new 
someone's kept them that way 
quite a bit of mud caked 
on the soles 
analysis shows it's from sussex 
with london mud overlaying it 
how do you know pollen clear as a 
map reference south of the river 
this kid came to london from sussex 
behind what happened to him 
something bad 
he loved those shoes remember 
he'd never leave them filthy 
wouldn't let them go 
unless he had to 
so a child with big feet gets 
oh 
what 
carl powers 
sorry who 
carl powers john 
what is it 
it's where i began 
from brighton for a school sports 
tournament drowned in the pool 
tragic accident you wouldn't 
remember it but you remember 
yes something fishy about it 
nobody thought so 
nobody except me 
i was only a kid myself 
i read about it in the papers 
you started young didn't you 
the boy carl powers 
had some kind of fit in the water 
but by the time they got him out 
it was too late 
there was something wrong somewhere 
i couldn't get it out of my head 
what his shoes what about them 
they weren't there i made a fuss 
i tried to get the police 
interested but nobody seemed 
to think it was important 
he'd left all the rest 
of his clothes in his locker 
but there was no sign of his shoes 
until now 
clock ticks 
siren wails in distance 
can i help 
i want to help 
there's only five hours left 
mobile beeps 
it's your brother 
he's texting me now 
how does he know my number 
must be a root canal 
look he did saynational 
importance hmm 
how quaint 
what is 
you are queen and country 
you can't just ignore it 
i'm not ignoring it 
putting my best man onto it 
right now 
right good 
clears throat 
who's that 
john how nice i was hoping 
it wouldn't be long 
how can i help you 
thank you 
um i was wanting to 
your brother sent me to collect 
more facts 
about the stolen plans - 
the missile plans 
did he 
yes he's investigating now 
he's erinvestigating away 
i just wondered what else 
you could tell me about the dead man 
er 27 clerk at vauxhall cross 
mi6 
he was involved in 
the bruce-partington program 
in a minor capacity 
security checks a-ok 
no known terrorist affiliations 
or sympathies 
last seen by his fiancee 
lucy love i've got to go out 
i've got to see someone 
westie 
he was found at battersea yes 
so he got on the train 
no 
what 
he had an oyster card 
he must have bought a ticket 
hm there was no ticket on the body 
then how did he end up with 
a bashed-in brain on the tracks 
at battersea 
that is the question - 
the one i was rather hoping sherlock 
would provide an answer to 
how's he getting on 
he's fine 
and it is goingvery well 
he's um 
he's completely focused on it 
clock ticks 
poison 
what are you going on about 
clostridium botulinum 
it's one of the deadliest poisons 
on the planet 
carl powers 
are you saying he was murdered 
remember the shoelaces 
mmm 
he suffered from eczema it would 
be easy to introduce the poison 
into his medication 
two hours later he comes to london 
the poison paralyses the muscles 
and he drowns 
how come the autopsy didn't pick that 
up it's virtually undetectable 
nobody was looking for it 
there are still tiny traces of it 
in the trainers 
from where he put the cream 
on his feet 
that's why they had to go 
so how do we let the bomber know 
get his attention stop the clock 
the killer kept the shoes 
all these years yes 
meaning 
he's our bomber

we've found it 
the car was hired yesterday morning 
by an ian monkford 
banker of some kind 
city boy paid in cash 
told his wife he was going away 
on a business trip never arrived 
you're still hanging round him 
yeah well 
opposites attract i s'pose

stamps maybe model trains safer 
before you ask 
yes it's monkford's blood 
dna checks out 
no body 
not yet 
get a sample sent to the lab 
oh 
mrs monkford 
yes sorry but i've already spoken 
with two policemen 
we're not from the police we're 
tearfully: sherlock holmes 
very old friend of your husband's 
we um 
we grew up together 
i'm sorry who i don't think 
he ever mentioned you 
oh he must have done this is 
this is horrible 
i mean i just can't believe it 
i only saw him the other day 
same old ian 
not a care in the world 
sorry my husband has been 
depressed for months who are you 
really strange that he hired a car 
why would he do that 
it's a bit suspicious isn't it 
no it isn't he forgot to renew 
the tax on the car that's all 
ah well that was ian 
that was ian all over 
no it wasn't 
normal voice: wasn't it interesting 
who was that 
why did you lie to her 
people don't like telling you things 
but they love to contradict you 
past tense did you notice 
what i referred to her husband 
in the past tense 
she joined in bit premature 
they've only just found the car 
you think she murdered her husband 
that's not a mistake 
a murderer would make i see

i can see you're not a car man eh 
but surely you can afford one - 
a mazda i mean yeah fair point 
it's like working in a sweet shop 
once you start eating the liquorice 
allsorts where does it stop 
you didn't know mr monkford 
no he was just a client 
he came in here 
and hired one of my cars 
i've no idea what happened to him 
poor sod 
nice holiday mr ewart eh you've 
been away haven't you oh the 
no it's sun beds i'm afraid 
too busy to get away my wife

oh well thank you very much 
for your time mr ewart 
you've been very helpful 
come on john 
i've got change if you still want

i needed to look inside his wallet 
why 
mr ewart's a liar 
fizzing 
phone rings 
hello 
the clue's in the name - janus cars 
why would you be giving me a clue 
why does anyone do anything 
because i'm bored 
we were made for each other 
sherlock 
then talk to me in your own voice 
patience 
clock ticks 
how much blood was on that seat 
would you say 
how much about a pint 
not about exactly a pint 
that was their first mistake 
the blood's ian monkford's 
but it's been frozen 
frozen 
there are clear signs 
i think ian monkford gave 
a pint of his blood some time ago 
and that's what they spread 
on the seat who did janus cars 
the clue's in the name 
the god with two faces 
exactly 
they provide a very special service 
if you've got any kind 
of a problem - money troubles 
bad marriage whatever - 
janus cars will help you disappear 
ian monkford was in trouble - 
financial at a guess he's 
a banker - couldn't see a way out 
but if he were to vanish 
if the car he hired was found with 
his blood on the driver's seat 
so where is he 
colombia colombia 
mr ewart of janus cars 
had a 20000 colombian peso note 
in his wallet 
quite a bit of change too 
he told us he hadn't been abroad 
recently 
but when i asked him about the cars 
i could see his tan line clearly 
no-one wears a shirt on a sun bed 
that plus his arm his arm 
he kept scratching it obviously 
irritating him and bleeding 
he'd recently had a booster jab 
hep-b probably 
hard to tell at that distance 
he's just back from settling 
ian monkford into his new life 
in colombia 
mrs monkford cashes in 
the life insurance 
and she splits it with janus cars 
mrs monkford 
oh yes she's in on it too 
go and arrest them inspector 
that's what you do best 
we need to let our bomber know 
the case is solved 
i am on fire

man: 'he says 
help

tetanus bacteria enters the

i s'pose 
something's wrong with this picture 
eh 
can't be that simple otherwise 
the bomber wouldn't be directing 
us towards it something's wrong 
john 
mm 
cut on her hand it's deep 
would have bled a lot right 
yeah 
but the wound's clean 
very clean and fresh 
how long would the bacteria 
have been incubating inside her 
oh eight ten days 
the cut was made later 
after she was dead 
must have been 
the only question is 
how did the tetanus enter 
the dead woman's system 
you want to help right 
of course 
connie prince's background - 
family history everything 
get me data right 
there's something else that 
we haven't thought of is there 
yes why is he doing this -

suspicious why point it up

who press-gangs suicide bombers 
bad samaritan 
i'mi'm serious sherlock 
listen i'm cutting you slack here

cat miaows 
we're devastated of course we are 
can i get you anything sir 
er no no thanks 
raoul is my rock 
i don't think i could have managed 
we didn't always see eye to eye 
but my sister was very dear to me 
cat miaows 
and to the er public mr prince 
oh she was adored 
i've seen her take girls who looked 
like the back end of routemasters 
and turn them into princesses 
still it's a relief in a way 
to know that she's beyond 
this vale of tears 
cat purrs 
absolutely 
great 
thank you thanks again 
it's a real shame i liked her 
she taught you 
how to do your colours 
colours 
you know what goes best with what 
i should never wear cerise 
apparently 
drains me 
who's that 
home office home office 
well home secretary actually 
owes me a favour a pretty girl 
but she messed about 
with herself too much 
they all do these days 
people can hardly move their faces 
it's silly isn't it 
did you ever see her show 
not until now 
connie prince: 'you look pasty love 
that's the brother 
no love lost there 
if you can believe the papers 
so i gather 
i've just had a fruitful chat with 
people who love this show 
the fan site's indispensable 
for gossip 
off off off off off off off' 
audience joins in chanting 
it's more common 
than people think 
the tetanus is in the soil 
people cut themselves on rose bushes 
garden forks 
that sort of thing 
and if left untreated 
i don't know 
what i'm going to do now right 
i mean she's left me this place 
which is lovely 
that's why 
my paper wanted to get the 
umthe full story 
straight from the horse's mouth 
are you sure it's not too soon 
no right 
you fire away 
cat miaows 
mobile phone rings 
john 'hi look get over here 
quickly i think i'm onto something 
some stuff first got a pen' 
i'll remember 
door closes 
that'll be him what 
ah mr prince isn't it 
yes 
very good to meet you 
yes thank you 
so sorry to hear about 
yes yes very kind 
shall we er 
clears throat 
you were right the bacteria 
got into her another way 
oh yes yes 
right are we all set 
er yes shall we um 
not too close i'm raw from crying 
cat miaows 
oh who's this 
sekhmet named after 
the egyptian goddess 
how nice was she connie's 
yes a little present 
from yours truly 
sherlock light reading 
oh er 
what are you playing at sorry 
you're like laurel and bloody hardy 
you two what's going on 
i think we've got what we came for 
excuse us what sherlock what 
we've got deadlines 
but you've not taken anything 
watson laughs 
yes ooh yes 
you think it was the cat 
it wasn't the cat 
what yes yeah it is 
it must be it's how he got 
the tetanus into her system 
its paws stink of disinfectant 
lovely idea 
no he coated it 
onto the claws of her cat 
it's a new pet 
bound to be a bit jumpy around her 
a scratch is almost inevitable 
i thought of it when i saw the 
scratches on her arm but it's too 
random and clever for the brother 
he murdered his sister for her 
money did he didn't he 
nope it was revenge 
rev who wanted revenge 
raoul the houseboy 
kenny prince was the butt 
of his sister's jokes 
virtual bullying campaign finally 
he had enough fell out with her 
badly it's all on the website 
she threatened to disinherit kenny 
raoul had grown accustomed to a 
certain lifestyle wait wait 
wait a second what about the 
disinfectant on the cat's claws 
raoul keeps a very clean house 
you came through the kitchen door 
saw the state of that floor - 
scrubbed within an inch of its life 
you smell of disinfectant 
no the cat doesn't come into it 
raoul's internet records do though 
i hope we can get a cab from here 
clock ticks 
raoul de santos is your killer 
kenny prince's houseboy 
second autopsy shows it wasn't 
tetanus that poisoned connie prince 
it was botulinum toxin 
we've been here before 
carl powers tut-tut 
our bomber's repeated himself 
so how'd he do it 
botox injection botox 
botox is a diluted form 
of botulinum among other things 
raoul de santos 
was employed to give connie 
her regular facial injections 
my contact at the home office 
gave me the complete records 
of raoul's internet purchases 
he's been bulk-ordering botox 
for months 
bided his time then upped 
the strength to a fatal dose 
are you sure about this i'm sure 
all right my office 
hey sherlock how long what 
how long have you known 
well this one was quite simple 
and the bomber repeated himself 
that was a mistake 
no but sherlock the hostage 
the old woman she's been there 
all this time 
i knew i could save her 
i also knew that the bomber 
had given us 12 hours 
i solved the case quickly that gave 
me time to get on with other things 
don't you see we're one up on him 
phone rings 
hello 
help me 
tell us where you are 
address 'he was so' 
his voice 
no no no no 
tell me nothing about him nothing 
he sounded so soft 
dialling tone 
hello 
sherlock 
what's happened 
reporter: 'the explosion 
floors killing 12 people' 
old block of flats 
from the utility company' 
he certainly gets about 
well obviously i lost that round 
although technically 
i did solve the case 
he killed the old lady 
because she started to describe him 
just once 
he put himself in the firing line 
what d'you mean 
well usually he 
must stay above it all 
he organises these things 
but no-one ever has direct contact 
what like the connie prince murder 
he arranged that 
so people come to him 
wanting their crimes fixed up 
like booking a holiday 
novel 
huh 
camera shutters click 
taking his time this time 
watson clears his throat 
anything on the carl powers case 
nothing 
all the living classmates 
check out spotless no connection 
maybe the killer was older than carl 
the thought had occurred 
so why is he doing this then 
playing this game with you 
do you think he wants to be caught 
i think he wants to be distracted 
oh 
i hope you'll be 
very happy together 
sorry what 
there are lives at stake sherlock 
actual human lives just so i know 
do you care about that at all 
will caring about them 
help save them nope 
then i'll continue not to make 
that mistake and you find that 
easy do you yes very 
is that news to you no no 
i've disappointed you 
that's good 
that's a good deduction yeah 
don't make people into heroes john 
heroes don't exist and if they did 
i wouldn't be one of them 
mobile phone beeps 
excellent 
a view of the thames 
south bank somewhere between 
southwark bridge and waterloo 
you check the papers 
i'll look online 
oh you're angry with me 
so you won't help 
not much cop this caring lark 
siren wails 
archway suicide ten-a-penny 
two kids stabbed in stoke newington 
ah man found on the train line 
andrew west 
nothing 
ringing tone 
it's me have you found anything 
on the south bank between waterloo 
bridge and southwark bridge 
birdsong 
do you reckon this is connected 
then the bomber 
must be odd though 
he hasn't been in touch 
then we must assume that some poor 
bugger's primed to explode yeah 
yes 
any ideas seven so far 
seven 
he's dead about 24 hours 
maybe a bit longer did he drown 
apparently not not enough of the 
thames in his lungs asphyxiated 
yes i'd agree 
there's quite a bit of bruising 
around the nose and mouth 
more bruises 
here and here 
fingertips 
he's late 30s i'd say 
not in the best condition 
he's been in the river a long while 
the water's destroyed 
most of the data 
but i'll tell you one thing 
that lost vermeer painting's a fake 
what 
we need to identify the corpse 
find out about his friends and 
wait wait wait wait what 
painting what are you on about 
it's all over the place 
haven't you seen the posters 
dutch old master supposed to 
have been destroyed centuries ago 
now it's turned up 
worth 30 million 
ok so what has that 
got to do with the stiff 
everything 
have you ever heard of the golem 
golem 
it's a horror story isn't it 
what are you saying 
jewish folk story 
a gigantic man made of clay - 
it's also the name of an assassin 
real name - oskar dzundza 
one of the deadliest assassins 
in the world 
that is his trademark style 
so this is a hit definitely 
the golem squeezes the life out of 
his victims with his bare hands 
but what has this got to do 
with that painting i don't see 
you do see you just don't observe 
yes all right all right girls 
calm down 
sherlock do you want to 
take us through it 
what do we know about this corpse 
the killer's not left us with much 
just the shirt and the trousers 
they're pretty formal maybe 
he was going out for the night 
the trousers are heavy duty 
polyester nasty 
same as the shirt cheap 
they're both too big for him so 
some kind of standard-issue uniform 
dressed for work then 
what kind of work 
there's a hook on his belt 
for a walkie-talkie 
tube driver 
security guard more likely 
that'll be borne out 
by his backside backside 
flabby you'd think he'd led 
a sedentary life 
yet the soles of his feet 
and the nascent varicose veins 
in his legs show otherwise 
so a lot of walking 
and a lot of sitting around 
security guard's looking good 
the watch helps too 
the alarm shows 
he did regular night shifts 
maybe he just set his alarm 
like that the night before he died 
no no no the buttons are stiff 
hardly touched 
he set his alarm like that a long 
time ago his routine never varied 
but there's something else the 
killer must have been interrupted 
otherwise he would have 
stripped the corpse completely 
there was some kind of badge 
or insignia on the shirt front 
that he tore off 
suggesting the dead man 
works somewhere recognisable 
some kind of institution 
i found this 
inside his trouser pockets 
sodden by the river 
but still recognisably 
tickets ticket stubs 
he worked in a museum or gallery 
did a quick check 
the hickman gallery has reported 
one of its attendants as missing - 
alex woodbridge 
tonight they unveil 
the rediscovered masterpiece 
now why would anyone 
want to pay the golem 
to suffocate a perfectly ordinary 
gallery attendant 
inference the dead man 
knew something about it 
something that would stop the owner 
getting paid 30 million 
the pictures are fake fantastic 
meretricious and a happy new year 
poor sod 
i'd better get my feelers out 
for this golem character 
pointless you'll never find him 
but i know a man who can 
who me 
why hasn't he phoned 
he's broken his pattern why 
waterloo bridge 
where now the gallery 
in a bit 
the hickman's contemporary art 
isn't it 
why have they got hold 
of an old master don't know 
dangerous to jump to conclusions 
need data 
stop 
can you wait here 
i won't be a moment 
sherlock 
change any change 
what for cup of tea of course 
here you go 50 
thanks 
what are you doing investing 
now we go to the gallery 
have you got any cash 
no i need you to find out all 
you can about the gallery attendant 
lestrade will give you the address 
ok 
we'd been sharing about a year

this is you isn't it 
inspector my time is being wasted 
would you mind showing yourself

and cairns were killed

there you go go and find out 
where he is and pick him up 
van buren supernova so-called 
exploding star 
only appeared in the sky in 1858 
so how could it have been 
painted in the 1640s 
phone beeps 
oh 
oh 
oh sherl 
you know it's interesting 
bohemian stationery 
an assassin named after a prague 
legend and you miss wenceslas 
this whole case has a distinctly 
czech feeling about it 
is that where this leads 
what are we looking at inspector 
well criminal conspiracy fraud 
accessory after the fact 
at the very least 
the murder of the old woman 
all the people in the flat 
i didn't know anything about that 
all those things please 
believe me 
i just wanted my share 
the 30 million 
she sighs 
i found a little old man in 
argentina 
a genius - i mean really 
brushwork immaculate 
could fool anyone mmm 
well nearly anyone 
but i didn't know how to go about 
convincing the world the picture 
was genuine 
it was just an idea 
a spark which he blew into a flame 
who 
i don't know 
lestrade laughs 
it's true 
it took a long time 
but eventually i was 
put in touch with people 
his people 
well there was never any real 
contact 
just messages 
and did those whispers have a name 
moriarty 
watson: so this is where west was 
found yeah 
are you going to be long 
i might be 
are you the police then 
sort of 
i hate 'em the police 
no jumpers 
people who chuck 'emselves in 
front of trains selfish bastards 
well that's one way of looking 
at it 
i mean it it's all right for them 
it's over in a split second 
strawberry jam all over the lines 
what about the drivers eh 
they've got to live with it 
haven't they 
yeah speaking of strawberry jam 
there's no blood on the line 
has it been cleaned off 
no there wasn't that much 
you said his head was smashed in 
it was but there wasn't much blood 
ok 
well i'll leave you to it then 
just give us a shout when 
you're off right 
right so andrew westgot on 
the train somewhere or did he 
there was no ticket on the body 
how did he end up here 
clanking 
the points yes 
i knew you'd get there eventually 
west wasn't killed here that's 
why there was so little blood 
how long have you been following 
me since the start 
you don't think 
i'd give up on a case like this 
just to spite my brother do you 
come on 
we've got a bit of burglary to do 
missile defence plans 
haven't left the country 
otherwise mycroft's people 
would have heard about it 
despite what people think 
we do still have a secret service 
yeah i know i've met them 
which means whoever stole 
the memory stick can't sell it 
or doesn't know what to do with it 
my money's on the latter 
we're here 
where 
sherlock what if there's 
someone in 
there isn't 
watson: jesus 
where are we oh sorry didn't 
i say joe harrison's flat 
joe 
brother of west's fiancee 
he stole the memory stick 
killed his prospective 
brother-in-law 
then why did he do it 
keys rattling 
let's ask him 
don't don't 
he wasn't meant to 
what's lucy gonna say jesus 
why did you kill him 
it was an accident i swear it was 
but stealing the plans 
for the missile defence program 
wasn't an accident was it 
i started dealing drugs 
i mean the bike thing's 
a great cover right 
i don't know how it started 
i just got out of my depth 
i owed people thousands 
serious people 
then at westie's engagement do 
he starts talking about his job 
i mean usually he's so careful 
he really opened up 
missile plans 
he waved it in front of me' 
you hear about these things 
getting lost 
ending up on rubbish tips 
and whatnot 
but there it was and i thought 
it could be worth a fortune 
off him he was so plastered' 
next time i saw him 
face that he knew' 
what are you doing here 
what have you done with the plans 
what happened 
but it was too late 
to do so i dragged him in 'ere' 
i just sat in the dark thinking 
when a neat little idea 
popped into your head 
carrying andrew west way away from 
here his body would have gone on 
for ages 
if the train hadn't hit 
a stretch of track that curved 
and points exactly 
do you still have it then - 
the memory stick 
fetch it for me 
if you wouldn't mind 
distraction over - 
the game continues 
maybe that's over too 
we've heard nothing from the bomber 
five pips remember john 
it's a countdown 
we've only had four 
shouting on television 
no no no 
course he's not the boy's father 
look at the turn-ups on his jeans 
i knew it was dangerous hm 
getting you into crap telly 
not a patch on connie prince 
have you given mycroft the memory 
stick yet yep he was over the moon 
threatened me with a 
knighthoodagain 
you know i'm still waiting hm 
for you to admit that a little 
knowledge of the solar system 
and you'd have cleared up 
the fake painting a lot quicker 
it didn't do you any good did it 
no but i'm not the world's 
only consulting detective 
true i won't be in for tea 
i'm going to sarah's there's still 
some of that risotto left in 
the fridge 
milk we need milk i'll get some 
really really 
and some beans then mm 
door closes 
footsteps 
bought you a little 
getting-to-know-you present 
that's what it's all been for 
isn't it 
all your little puzzles 
making me dance 
all to distract me from this 
evening 
this is a turn-up isn't it 
sherlock 
john what the hell 
bet you never saw this coming 
whatwould you like me 
to make him saynext 
gottle o' gear gottle o' gear 
gottle o' gear stop it 
nice touch this the pool 
where little carl died 
i stopped him

l9a1 in your pocket 
or are you just pleased to see me 
both 
jim moriarty hi 
jim 
jim from the hospital 
oh did i really make 
such a fleeting impression 
but then i suppose 
that was rather the point 
don't be silly 
someone else is holding the rifle 
i don't like getting my hands dirty 
i've given you a glimpse 
sherlock just a teensy glimpse 
of what i've got going on 
out there in the big bad world 
i'm a specialist you see 
like you 
dear jim 
to get rid of my lover's 
nasty sister 
dear jim please will you fix it for 
me to disappear to south america 
just so 
consulting criminal 
brilliant isn't it 
no-one ever gets to me 
and no-one ever will 
i did 
cocks gun 
you've come the closest 
now you're in my way 
thank you 
didn't mean it as a compliment 
yes you did yeah ok i did 
but the flirting's over sherlock 
singsong 
daddy's had enough now 
i've shown you what i can do 
i cut loose all those people 
all those little problems 
even 30 million quid just 
to get you to come out and play 
so take this as a friendly 
warning my dear 
back off 
although i have loved this 
this little game of ours 
playing jim from it playing gay 
did you like 
the little touch with the underwear 
people have died 
that's what people do 
i will stop you no you won't 
are you all right 
you can talk johnny boy 
go ahead 
take it mm oh 
boring 
i could have got them anywhere 
sherlock run 
he laughs 
good 
very good 
if your sniper pulls that trigger 
mr moriarty then we both go up 
isn't he sweet i can see 
why you like having him around 
but then people do get 
so sentimental about their pets 
they're so touchingly loyal 
but oops 
you've rather shown 
your hand there dr watson 
gotcha 
westwood do you know what happens 
if you don't leave me alone 
sherlock to you 
oh let me guess i get killed

something special

if you don't stop prying 
i'll burn you 
i'll burn the heart out of you 
i have been reliably informed 
that i don't have one 
but we both know that's not 
quite true 
well i'd better be off 
well so nice to have had a 
proper chat 
what if i was to shoot you now 
right now 
then you could cherish 
the look of surprise on my face 
cos i'd be surprised sherlock 
really i would 
and just a teensy 
bitdisappointed 
and of course you wouldn't be able 
to cherish it for very long

about me why would it upset you 
just try to keep a low profile find yourself a little case this week 
stay out of the news 
mobile bleeps

so did you just talk to him for a really long time 
oh henry fishguard never committed suicide

sir i'm going to have to ask you to leave 
door bangs 
sir there's been a break-in 
not our division 
you'll want it

bank of england 
alarm sounds

that glass is tougher than anything 
not tougher than crystallised carbon he used a diamond 
intelligent fine let's give "smart-arse" a wide berth 
today outside the old bailey 
james moriarty earlier today accused of 
at the old bailey we have reichenbach hero sherlock holmes 
would you mind slipping your hand into my pocket 
thanks 
crown v moriarty please proceed to court 10 
you're him 
i read your cases follow them all 
sign my shirt would you 
guess which one i am 
those marks on your forearm edge of a desk 
you've been typing in a hurry probably pressure on facing a deadline 
that all 
there's an ink smudge on your wrist a bulge in your jacket pocket 
hmm oil-based used in newspaper print 
journalist unlikely you get your hands dirty at the press 
i'd make a great feature "sherlock holmes the man beneath the hat" 
kitty 
riley pleased to meet you 
i'm saving you the job of asking i won't give you an interview no i don't want the money 
you and john watson just platonic can i put you down for a "no" there as well() 
there's all sorts of gossip in the press about you 
sooner or later you're going to need someone on your side 
someone to set the record straight 
you think you're the girl for that job do you 
i'm smart and you can trust me 
smart ok investigative journalist 
good well look at me and tell me what you see 
if you're that skilful you don't need an interview 
you can just read what you need 
no ok my turn 
i see someone who's waiting for their first scoop so their editor will notice them 
you're wearing an expensive skirt that's been rehemmed twice only posh skirt you've got 
your nails you can't afford to do them that often i see someone who's hungry 
i don't see smart i don't see trustworthy i'll give you a quote if you like three little words 
you repel me 
your words can you expand on that answer 
no the sort who'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination 
but i'm sure he'd make a decent job of your boiler 
would you describe him as 
ask me how how would i describe him 
what opinion have i formed of him do they not teach you this 
mr holmes we are fine without your help 
how would you describe this man his character 
first mistake 
james moriarty isn't a man at all 
he's a spider 
a spider at the centre of a web a criminal web with a thousand threads 
and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances 
she clears throat 
how long have i known him not your best line of enquiry 
we met twice five minutes in total 
i pulled a gun he tried to blow me up 
i felt we had a special something 
miss sorrel are you seriously claiming this man is an expert 
after knowing the accused for just five minutes 
two minutes would have made me an expert five was ample 
one librarian two teachers 
two high-pressure jobs probably the city 
seven are married two are having an affair with each other 
you've been called here to answer miss sorrel's questions 
not to give us a display of your intellectual prowess 
keep your answers brief and to the point 
anything else will be treated as contempt 
do you think you could survive for just a few minutes 
without showing off 
cell door slams 
what did i say i said don't get clever 
you were there for the whole thing up in the gallery start to finish 
like you said it would be - sat on his backside never even stirred 
moriarty is not mounting any defence 
bank of england tower of london pentonville 
three of the most secure places in the country 
and six weeks ago moriarty breaks in 
no-one knows how or why 
it's my face 
yes and you're doing a "we both know what's really going on here" face 
if moriarty wanted the jewels he'd have them 
if he wanted the prisoners freed they'd be on the streets 
the reason he's still in a prison cell is cos he chose to be there 
somehow this is part of his scheme 
mr crayhill can we have your first witness 
your honour we're not calling any witnesses 
i don't follow 
you've entered a plea of not guilty 
nevertheless my client is offering no evidence 
the defencerests 
ladies and gentlemen of the jury james moriarty stands accused 
of several counts of attempted burglary 
crimes which if he's found guilty 
will elicit a very long custodial sentence 
and yethis legal team 
has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever 
to support their plea 
i find myself in the unusual position 
of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly 
you must find him guilty 
guilty 
you must find him guilty 
door slams 
surprised it took them that long to be honest 
there's a queue for the loo 
have you reached a verdict on which you all agree 
phone rings 
not guilty they found him not guilty 
no defence and moriarty's walked free 
sherlock 
are you listening he's out you know he'll be coming after you sherl 
violin plays 
stairs creak 
music stops 
violin plays again 
door creaks 
most people knock 
but then you're not most people i suppose 
kettle's just boiled 
johann sebastian would be appalled 
you know when he was on his deathbed bach 
he heard his son at the piano playing one of hispieces 
the boy stopped before he got to the end 
the dying man jumped out of bed ran to the piano and finished it 
with me back on the streets 
every fairy tale needs a good old-fashioned villain 
you need me or you're nothing 
because we're just alike you and i 
except you're boring 
you're on the side of the angels 
you got to the jury of course 
i got into the tower of london 
you think i can't worm my way into 12 hotel rooms 
cable network 
every hotel bedroom has a personalised tv screen 
and every person has their pressure point 
someone that they want to protect from harm 
easy peasy 
so how are you going to do it 
burn me 
ah that's the problem the final problem 
have you worked out what it is yet 
what's the final problem 
i did tell you but did you listen 
how hard do you find it having to say "i don't know" 
speaking of clever have you told your little friends yet 
told them what 
because nothing in the bank of england 
the tower of london or pentonville prison could possibly match 
the value of the key that could get you into all three 
i can open any door anywhere with a few tiny lines of computer code 
no such thing as a private bank account now they're all mine 
no such thing as secrecy i own secrecy 
nuclear codes 
i could blow up nato in alphabetical order 
in a world of locked rooms the man with the key is king 
and honey you should see me in a crown 
you were advertising all through the trial 
you were showing the world what you can do 
and you were helping 
big client list - rogue governments intelligence communities 
terrorist cells 
they all want me 
suddenly i'm mr sex 
if you can break any bank what do you care about the highest bidder 
i don't i just like to watch them all competing 
well you know you've got john i should get myself a live-in one 
you don't want money or power not really 
what is it all for 
i want to solve the problem 
our problem 
the final problem 
it's going to start very soon sherlockthe fall 
he whistles 
but don't be scared falling is just like flying 
except there's a more permanent destination 
never liked riddles 
learn to 
because i owe you a fall sherlock 
ioweyou 
keypad bleeps 
er excuse me i'm looking for mycroft holmes 
would you happen to know if he's around at all 
can you not hear me 
yes all right anyone 
anyone at all know 
where mycroft holmes is i've been asked to meet him here 
no takers right am i invisible can you actually see me 
ah thanks gents i've been asked to meet mycroft holmes what the hell 
muffled cries from john 
tradition john our traditions define us 
so total silence is traditional is it 
you can't even say pass the sugar 
three-quarters of the diplomatic service 
and half the government front bench all sharing one tea trolley 
it's for the best believe me 
we don't want a repeat of1972 
saturday they're doing a big expose 
i'd love to know where she got her information 
someone called brook recognise the name 
school friend maybe 
but that's not why i asked you here 
hm i was thinking of doing a drinks thing for the neighbours 
i'm not sure you'll want to 
sulejmani albanian hit squad expertly trained killer 
living less than 20 feet from your front door 
well it's a great location jubilee line's handy 
dyachenko ludmila 
oh 
she's taken the flat opposite 
ok 
i'm sensing a pattern here 
in fact four top international assassins relocate 
to within spitting distance of 221b 
you think this is moriarty 
he promised sherlock he'd come back 
why don't you talk to sherlock if you're so concerned about him 
oh god don't tell me 
too much history between us john 
old scores resentments 
nicked all his smurfs broke his action man 
we both know what's coming john 
moriarty is obsessed he's sworn to destroy his only rival 
so you want me to watch out for your brother because he won't accept your help 
if it's not too much trouble 
door bangs 
not him his children max and claudette age seven and nine 
school broke up the boarders went home 
isn't it great to be working with a celebrity 
we shouldn't need to keep you for much longer thank you 
miss mackenzie you're in charge of pupil welfare 
yet you left this place wide open last night 
what are you an idiot a drunk or a criminal quickly tell me 
all the doors and windows were properly bolted 
no-one not even me went into their room last night 
miss mackenzie will need to breath into a bag now 
she sobs 
six grand a term you'd expect them to keep the kids safe for you 
you said the other kids had all left on their holidays 
they were the only two sleeping on this floor 
there's absolutely no sign of a break-in 
the intruder must have been hidden inside some place 
show me where the brother slept 
the boy sleeps there every night 
gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor 
he'd recognise every shape every outline 
the silhouette of everyone who came to the door 
an intruder maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon 
what would he do 
in the precious few seconds before they came into the room 
how would he use them if not to cry out 
this little boy this particular little boy 
who reads all of those spy books what would he do 
he'd leave a sign 
he sniffs 
get anderson 
linseed oil 
floor 
gun held to his head 
the girl was pulled beside him dragged sideways 
he had his left arm cradled about her neck 
that's the end of it we don't know where they went from here 
tells us nothing after all 
you're right anderson nothing 
except his shoe size his height his gait his walking pace 
sherlock laughs 
maybe don't do the smiling kidnapped children 
how could he get past the cctv if all the doors were locked 
he walked in when they weren't locked 
but a stranger can't just walk into a school like that 
anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment 
yesterday end of term parents milling around chauffeurs staff 
what's one more stranger among that lot 
he was waiting for them 
all he had to do was find a place to hide 
molly 
one of your old boyfriends we're tracking him down 
jim wasn't my boyfriend we went out three times i ended it 
then he stole the crown jewels broke into the bank of england and organised a prison break 
for the sake of law and order i suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship molly 
oil john the oil in the kidnapper's footprint 
it'll lead us to moriarty 
all the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved 
the sole of the shoe is like a passport if we're lucky we'll see everything he's been up to 
i need that analysis 
alkaline 
iou 
glycerol molecule 
what did you mean iou 
you said iou 
you're a bit like my dad he's dead no sorry 
molly please don't feel the need to make conversation it's really not your area 
when he was dying he was always cheerful he was lovely 
except when he thought no-one could see 
you look sad when you think he can't see you 
are you ok and don't just say you are because i know what that means 
looking sad when you think no-one can see you 
what i'm trying to say is that if there's anything i can do 
anything you need anything at all you can have me 
no i just mean i mean if there's anything you need it's fine 
but what can i need from you 
nothing i don't know 
you could probably say thank you actually 
thank you 
i'm just going to go and get some crisps do you want anything 
it's ok i know you don't 
on our doorstep found it today yes and look at that 
look at that exactly the same seal 
a little trace of breadcrumbs 
hardback copy of fairy tales 
two children led into the forest by a wicked father follow a little trail of breadcrumbs 
that's hansel and gretel what sort of kidnapper leaves clues 
the sort that likes to boast that thinks it's a game 
he sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me 
the glycerol molecule 
this fax arrived an hour ago 
phone rings 
what have you got for us 
we need to find a place in the city where all five of these things intersect 
chalk asphalt brick dust vegetation 
we need to narrow that down a sweet factory with asphalt 
no too general something more specific 
chalk chalky clay that's a far thinner band of geology 
brick dust 
building site bricks from the 1950s 
there's thousands of building sites in london 
homeless network faster than the police 
far more relaxed about taking bribes 
phones ring 
john 
rhododendron ponticum matches 
a mile of disused factories between the river and the park matches everything 
right come on come on 
sirens blare 
ok you look over there 
look everywhere 
ok spread out please spread out 
this was alight moments ago they're still here sweet wrappers 
what's he been feeding you hansel and gretel 
he sniffs 
ugh 
the papers they're painted with mercury lethal 
the more they ate 
taken in large enough quantities eventually it would kill them 
he didn't need to be there for the execution 
murder by remote control he could be 1000 miles away 
the hungrier they got the more they ate the faster they died neat 
i've got him don't worry 
right then the professionals are finished 
if the amateurs want to go in and have their turn 
now remember she's in shock and she's just seven years old 
so anything you can do to 
claudette i 
he's still in intensive care 
don't let it get to you 
i always feel like screaming when you walk into a room 
in fact so do most people 
come on 
siren blares outside 
brilliant work you did finding those kids from just a footprint 
it's really amazing 
thank you 
unbelievable 
ah 
problem 
can you turn this off 
hello 
are you ready for the story 
this is the story of sir boast-a-lot 
a footprint it's all he had 
a footprint 
yeah well you know what he's like csi baker street 
well our boys couldn't have done it 
and what's the other 
sir boast-a-lot was the bravest and cleverest knight at the round table 
but soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories 
about how brave he was and how many dragons he'd slain 
and soon they began to wonder "are sir boast-a-lot's stories even true" 
only he could have found that evidence 
oh no 
the girl screams her head off when she sees him - a man she has never seen before 
you know what it is you just don't want to think about it 
so all of the knights went to king arthur and said 
she mouths 
you're not seriously suggesting he's involved are you 
we have to entertain the possibility 
and then even the king began to wonder 
but that wasn't the end of sir boast-a-lot's problem 
no 
that wasn't the final problem 
the end 
stop the cab 
stop the cab 
what was that 
what was that 
no charge 
watch out 
tyres squeal 
thank you 
gunfire 
sherlock 
that is him it's him 
sulejmani or something mycroft showed me his file 
he's a big albanian gangster lives two doors down from us 
he saved my life but he couldn't touch me why 
four assassins living right on our doorstep 
they haven't come here to kill me 
they have to keep me alive 
i've got something that all of them want 
but if one of them approaches me 
the others kill them before they can get it 
all of the attention is focused on me 
there's a surveillance web closing in on us right now 
so what have you got that's so important 
i need to ask about the dusting 
precise details in the last week what's been cleaned 
any break in the dust line you can put back anything but dust dust is eloquent 
cameras we're being watched 
what cameras here 
footsteps on stairs 
you want to take me to the station saving you the trouble of asking 
sherlock 
who was it donovan i bet it was donovan 
ha ha moriarty is smart 
he planted that doubt in her head that little nagging sensation 
you're going to have to be strong to resist 
you can't kill an idea can you 
not once it's made a homethere 
moriarty's game 
first the scream then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning 
he wants to destroy me inch by inch 
it is a game lestrade and not one i'm willing to play 
give my regards to sergeant donovan 
computer bleeps 
i don't care what people think 
you'd care if they thought you were stupid or wrong 
no that would just make them stupid or wrong 
sherlock i don't want the world believing you're 
that i am what 
a fraud 
you can't entertain the possibility they may be right 
moriarty is playing with your mind too can't you see what's going on 
well nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time 
that bloke that's been in the press 
mm-hm 
i thought he was some sort of private eye 
not used him on any proper cases though have we 
well one or two 
or 20 or 30 
what 
an amateur detective given access to all sorts of classified information 
and now he's a suspect in a case 
now go and fetch him in right now 
do it 
what if he's done this to us every single time 
phone bleeps 
so still got some friends on the force it's lestrade 
says they're all coming over here now 
queuing up to slap on the handcuffs 
every officer you've ever made feel like a tit 
which is a lot of people 
yoo-hoo 
oh sorry am i interrupting 
some chap delivered a parcel i forgot marked perishable 
i had to sign for it 
funny name german like the fairy tales 
sirens blare 
burnt to a crisp 
what does it mean doorbell rings 
john: 'have you got a warrant have you' 
sherlock holmes i'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping 
no it's not all right this is ridiculous 
get him downstairs now 
you don't have to do this 
don't try to interfere or i shall arrest you too 
you done 
solving crimes won't be enough one day he'll cross the line 
now ask yourself what sort of man would kidnap those kids 
just so he can impress us all by finding them 
looked a bit of a weirdo if you ask me 
often are these vigilante types 
what are you looking at 
are you all right sir 
well apparently it's against the law to chin the chief superintendent 
hmm bit awkward this 
there's no-one to bail us 
i was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape 
ladies and gentlemen will you all please get on your knees 
just so you're aware the gun is his idea i'm just ayou know 
so what now 
doing what moriarty wants becoming a fugitive run 
get after him lestrade 
take my hand 
sirens blare 
sherlock wait 
we're going to need to coordinate 
siren blares 
everybody wants to believe it that's what makes it so clever 
a lie that's preferable to the truth 
my deductions were a sham no-one feels inadequate sherlock's an ordinary man 
mycroft he could help us 
big family reconciliation now's not really the moment 
sherlockwe're being followed i knew we couldn't outrun the police 
that's not the police it's one of my new neighbours from baker street 
let's see if he can give us some answers 
we're going to jump in front of that bus 
bus blasts horn 
oh 
tell me what you want from me 
tell me 
he left it at your flat 
what 
he's selling it the programme he used to break into the tower 
he planted it when he came around 
gunfire 
siren blares 
they pant 
it's a game-changer 
it's a key it can break into any system 
and it's sitting in our flat right now 
that's why he left that message telling everyone where to come "get sherlock" 
why plant it on you 
it's another subtle way of smearing my name 
now i'm best pals with all those criminals 
yeah well have you seen this 
a kiss-and-tell 
some bloke called rich brook 
who is he 
alarm bleeps 
too late to go on the record 
congratulations "the truth about sherlock holmes" 
the scoop that everybody wanted and you got it bravo 
i gave you your opportunity 
i wanted to be on your side remember 
you turned me down so 
then lo and behold someone spills all the beans 
how utterly convenient who is brook 
oh come on kitty no-one trusts the voice at the end of a phone 
all those little meetings in cafes 
those sessions in the hotel room when he gabbled into your dictaphone 
how do you know that you can trust him 
a man turns up with the holy grail in his pockets 
what were his credentials 
darling they didn't have any ground coffee so i just got normal 
you said that they wouldn't find me here you said that i'd be safe here 
you are safe 
richard i'm a witness they wouldn't harm you in front of witnesses 
so that's your source moriarty is richard brook 
of course he's richard brook there is no moriarty 
rich brook an actor sherlock holmes hired to be moriarty 
dr watson i know you're a good man 
don't don't don't hurt me 
no you are moriarty he's moriarty 
we've met remember you were going to blow me up 
i'm sorry i'm sorry 
he paid me i needed the work i'm an actor i was out of work 
sherlock you'd better explain because i am not getting this 
i'll be doing the explaining in print 
it's all here conclusive proof 
you invented james moriarty your nemesis 
he invented all the crimes actually 
and to cap it all he made up a master villain 
yes and you paid him to take the rap promised you'd rig the jury 
not exactly a west end role but i'll bet the money was good 
but not so good he didn't want to sell his story 
i am sorry i am i am sorry 
so this is the story you're going to publish 
i have proof show them kitty show them something 
yeah show me something 
i'm on tv i'm on kids' tv i'm the story-teller 
i'm the story-teller it's on dvd 
just tell him it's all coming out it's all over 
just tell them just tell them tell them it's all over now 
no don't you touch me don't you lay a finger on me 
stop it now 
leave him alone 
no no no he'll have back-up 
do you know what sherlock holmes 
i look at you know and i can read youand you repel me 
can he do that 
completely change his identity make you the criminal 
he's got my whole life story 
that's what you do when you sell a big lie 
you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable 
it'll be your word against his 
he's been sowing doubt into people's minds for 24 hours 
there's only one thing he needs to do to complete his game and that 
sherlock 
you're wrong you know 
you do count 
you've always counted and i've always trusted you 
but you were right 
i'm not ok 
tell me what's wrong 
molly i think i'm going to die 
everything that i think i am 
what do you need 
you 
she has really done her homework miss riley 
and it's things that only someone close to sherlock could know 
two names - yours and mine 
and moriarty didn't get this stuff from me 
do you go out for a coffee now and then you and jim 
your own brother 
and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac 
i never intendi never dreamt 
thisthis is what you were trying to tell me isn't it 
how did you meet him 
people like him we know about them we watch them 
but james moriarty 
and in his pocket the ultimate weapon 
the key code 
a few lines of computer code that can unlock any door 
and you abducted him to try and find the key code 
interrogated him for weeks 
he just sat there 
staring into the darkness 
the only thing that made him open up 
i could get him to talk just a little 
but 
in return you had to offer him sherlock's life story 
so one big lie 
and people will swallow it because the rest of it's true 
moriarty wanted sherlock destroyed right 
and you have given him the perfect ammunition 
john 
i'm sorry 
oh please 
tell him would you 
i got your message 
the computer code is the key to this we find it we can use it 
so we can break into the records and destroy richard brook 
bring back jim moriarty again 
somewhere in 221b 
somewhere on the day of the verdict he left it hidden 
uh-huh 
mobile rings 
oh 
yeah speaking 
what 
what happened is she ok 
oh my god right yes i'm coming 
you need to doesn't she mean anything to you 
you once half-killed a man because he laid a finger on her 
sod this sod this you stay here if you want on your own 
alone is what i have alone protects me 
no friends protect people 
text alert 
wellhere we are at last 
you and me sherlock 
and our problem - the final problem 
staying alive 
it's so boring isn't it 
it's just staying 
all my life i've been searching for distractions 
and you were the best distraction and now i don't even have you 
because i've beaten you 
and you know what in the end it was easy 
it was easy 
now i've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people 
and it turns out you're ordinary just like all of them 
ah well 
did you almost start to wonder if i was real 
did i nearly get you 
richard brook 
nobody seems to get the joke but you do 
richard brook in german is reichenbach 
good you got that too 
beats like digits 
every beat is a one every rest is a zero 
binary code 
that's why all those assassins tried to save my life 
it was hidden on me hidden inside my head 
a few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system 
told all my clients last one to sherlock is a sissy 
but now that it's up here i can use it to alter all the records 
i can kill rich brook and bring back jim moriarty 
no no no no no this is too easy 
this is too easy 
there is no key doofus 
those digits are meaningless they're utterly meaningless 
you don't really think a couple of lines of computer code 
are going to crash the world around our ears 
i'm disappointed in you ordinary sherlock 
daylight robbery all it takes is some willing participants 
i knew you'd fall for it that's your weakness 
you always want everything to be clever 
shall we finish the game one final act 
glad you chose a tall building nice way to do it 
do it do what 
yes of course 
my suicide 
genius detective proved to be a fraud 
i read it in the paper so it must be true 
i love newspapers 
fairy tales 
and pretty grim ones too 
oh god john you made me jump is everything ok with the police 
has sherlock sorted it all out 
oh my god 
taxi 
taxi no no no policesort of

john

there's no stopping them now 
you can have me arrested you can torture me 
you can do anything you like with me 
but nothing's going to prevent them from pulling the trigger 
your only three friends in the world will die unless 
unless i kill myself and complete your story 
you've got to admit that's sexier 
oh you've got an audience now 
off you pop 
go on 
i told you how this ends 
your death is the only thing that's going to call off the killers 
i'm certainly not going to do it 
would you give me one moment please 
one moment of privacy 
please 
of course 
he laughs 
what 
what is it 
what did i miss 
you're not going to do it 
so the killers can be called off 
then there's a recall code or a word or a number 
i don't have to die 
if i've got you 
oh 
you think you can make me stop the order 
couldn't make me do a thing i didn't want to 
yes but i'm not my brother remember

prepared to do anything 
prepared to burn 
prepared to do what ordinary people won't do 
you want me to shake hands with you in hell i shall not disappoint you 
nah

you're ordinary you're on the side of the angels 
oh i may be on the side of the angels

my husband

where is she 
the body of beth davenport 
junior minister for transport 
was found late last night 
on a building site in greater london 
preliminary investigations 
suggest that this was suicide 
we can confirm that this apparent 
suicide closely resembles those of 
sir jeffrey patterson 
and james phillimore 
in the light of this these incidents 
are now being treated as linked 
the investigation is ongoing 
but detective inspector lestrade 
will take questions now 
detective inspector 
how can suicides be linked 
well they all took the same poison 
they were all found in places 
they had no reason to be 
none of them had shown any prior 
indication but you can't have 
serial suicides 
well apparently you can 
these three people 
there's nothing that links them 
there's no link we've found yet but 
we're looking for it 
there has to be one 
if you've all got texts please 
ignore them it just says "wrong" 
well just ignore that 
if there are no more questions 
i'm going to bring 
this session to an end 
if they're suicides 
what are you investigating 
as i say these suicides 
are clearly linked 
it's an unusual situation we've 
got our best people investigating 
says "wrong" again 
one more question is there any 
chance that these are murders 
and if they are is this 
the work of a serial killer 
i know that you like 
writing about these but these 
do appear to be suicides 
we know the difference the poison 
was clearly self-administered 
yes but if they are murders 
how do people keep themselves safe 
well don't commit suicide 
daily mail 
this is a frightening time 
for people but all anyone has to do 
is exercise reasonable precautions 
we are all as safe as we want to be 
mobile phones buzz 
thank you 
you've got to stop him doing that 
he's making us look like idiots 
if you can tell me 
how he does it i'll stop him

yeah like that's going to happen() 
i don't know 
get a flatshare or something 
who'd want me for a flatmate 
what 
you're the second person 
to say that to me today 
who was the first 
how fresh 
just in 67 natural causes 
used to work here 
i knew him he was nice 
fine 
we'll start with the riding crop 
so bad day was it 
i need to know what bruises 
form in the next 20 minutes 
a man's alibi depends on it text me 
listen i was wondering 
maybe later when you're finished 
you're wearing lipstick 
you weren't wearing lipstick before 
i refreshed it a bit 
sorry you were saying 
i was wondering 
if you'd like to have coffee 
black two sugars please 
i'll be upstairs 
ok 
knock on door 
bit different from my day 
you've no idea 
mike can i borrow your phone 
there's no signal on mine 
and what's wrong with the landline 
i prefer to text 
sorry it's in my coat 
here use mine 
oh thank you 
this is an old friend of mine 
john watson 
afghanistan or iraq 
sorry 
which was it in afghanistan or iraq 
afghanistan sorry 
how did you know 
ah coffee thank you 
what happened to the lipstick 
it wasn't working for me 
really it was a big improvement 
your mouth's too small now 
ok 
how do you feel about the violin 
i'm sorry what 
i play the violin when i'm thinking 
and sometimes i don't talk for days 
on end would that bother you 
potential flatmates should know 
the worst about each other 
you told him about me not a word 
who said anything about flatmates 
i did told mike this morning 
that i must be a difficult man 
to find a flatmate for 
now here he is just after lunch with 
an old friend clearly just home from 
military service in afghanistan 
wasn't a difficult leap 
how did you know about afghanistan 
got my eye on a nice little place 
in central london 
we ought to be able to afford it 
we'll meet there tomorrow 
evening seven o'clock 
sorry got to dash i think i left 
my riding crop in the mortuary 
is that it 
is that what 
we've only just met and we're 
going to go and look at a flat 
problem 
we don't know 
a thing about each other 
i don't know where we're meeting 
i don't even know your name 
i know you're an army doctor 
and you've been invalided home 
from afghanistan 
you've got a brother worried 
about you but you won't go 
to him for help because you don't 
approve of him possibly because he's 
an alcoholic more likely because 
he recently walked out on his wife 
and i know that your therapist 
thinks your limp's psychosomatic 
quite correctly i'm afraid 
that's enough to be going 
on with don't you think 
the name's sherlock holmes 
and the address is 221b baker street 
afternoon 
yeah he's always like that 
hello 
ah - mr holmes sherlock please 
well this is a prime spot 
must be expensive 
mrs hudson the landlady - 
she's given me a special deal 
owes me a favour a few years back 
her husband got himself 
sentenced to death in florida 
i was able to help out sorry - you 
stopped her husband being executed 
oh no i ensured it 
sherlock 
mrs hudson dr john watson 
hello come in thank you 
shall we 
well this could be very nice 
very nice indeed 
yes 
yes i think so 
my thoughts precisely 
together: so i went straight ahead 
and moved in soon as we get all this 
rubbish cleaned out 
so this is all well obviously i 
can ermstraighten things up a bit 
that's a skull friend of mine 
when i say friend 
what do you think then dr watson 
there's another bedroom upstairs 
if you'll be needing two bedrooms 
of course we'll be needing two 
oh don't worry there's all sorts 
round here mrs turner next door's 
got (married ones) 
oh 
sherlock the mess you've made 
i looked you up on 
the internet last night 
anything interesting found your 
website the science of deduction 
what did you think 
you said you could identify 
a software designer by his tie and 
an airline pilot by his left thumb 
yes 
and i can read your military career 
in your face and your leg 
and your brother's drinking habits 
on your mobile phone 
how 
what about these suicides then 
sherlock i thought that'd be 
right up your street 
three exactly the same 
four 
there's been a fourth 
and there's something different 
this time a fourth 
where brixton lauriston gardens 
what's new about this one you 
wouldn't have come to me otherwise 
you know how they never leave notes 
yeah this one did 
will you come

well he won't be your assistant 
i need an assistant

brilliant yes 
four serial suicides and now a note

something cold will do john have 
a cup of tea make yourself at home

my husband was just the same 
but you're more 
the sitting-down type i can tell 
i'll make you that cuppa 
you rest your leg 
damn my leg sorry i'm so sorry - 
it's just sometimes 
this bloody thing 
i understand dear i've got a hip 
cup of tea'd be lovely thank you

i'm not your housekeeper 
couple of biscuits too if you've 
got 'em not your housekeeper 
you're a doctor 
in fact you're an army doctor 
yes

bit of trouble too i bet 
of course yes 
enough for a lifetime far too much 
want to see some more oh god yes 
sorry mrs hudson i'll skip the tea 
off out both of you 
impossible suicides four of them 
no point sitting at home when there's 
finally something fun going on 
look at you all happy it's not 
decent who cares about decent 
the game mrs hudson is on 
taxi 
ok you've got questions 
yeah where are we going 
crime scene next 
who are you what do you do 
what do you think 
i'd sayprivate detective but 
but the police don't go 
to private detectives 
i'm a consulting detective only 
one in the world i invented the job 
what does that mean means when 
the police are out of their depth 
which is always 
they consult me 
the police don't consult amateurs 
when i met you for the first time 
yesterday i said afghanistan 
or iraq you looked surprised 
yes how did you know 
i didn't know i saw 
you hold yourself says military 
bit different from my day 
so army doctor obvious 
been abroad but not sunbathing 
when you walk but you don't ask 
for a chair when you stand - 
psychosomatic 
of the injury were traumatic -' 
wounded in action then wounded in 
action suntan - afghanistan or iraq 
you said i had a therapist 
you've got a psychosomatic limp 
of course you've got a therapist 
then there's your brother mm 
your phone 
e-mail enabled mp3 player' 
and you're looking for a flatshare 
you wouldn't buy this - it's a gift 
not one many over time -' 
it's been in the same pocket 
as keys and coins 
you wouldn't treat 
your one luxury item like this 
so it's had a previous owner 
next bit's easy you know it already 
the engraving 
harry watson clearly a family 
member who's given you his old phone 
not your father 
this is a young man's gadget 
could be a cousin but you're a war 
hero who can't find a place to live - 
unlikely you've got an extended 
family not one you're close to 
so brother it is 
now who's clara three kisses 
says it's a romantic attachment 
the expense of the phone 
says wife not girlfriend 
must have given it to him recently 
it's only six months old 
marriage in trouble then - 
six months on he's given it away 
if she'd left him 
he would have kept it sentiment 
no he wanted rid of it he left her 
he gave the phone to you 
so he wants you to stay in touch 
you're looking for cheap 
accommodation but you're not 
going to your brother for help - 
that says you've got problems 
with him maybe you liked his wife 
or don't like his drinking 
how can you possibly know 
about the drinking 
shot in the dark good one though 
power connection - 
tiny little scuff marks round it 
every night he plugs it in 
but his hands are shaking 
you never see those marks 
on a sober man's phone 
never see a drunk's without them 
there you go you were right 
i was right right about what 
the police don't consult amateurs 
thatwas amazing 
do you think so of course it was 
it was extraordinary 
it was quite extraordinary 
that's not what people normally say 
what do people normally say 
piss off 
did i get anything wrong 
harry and me don't get on 
never have 
clara and harry split up 
three months ago 
and they're getting a divorce 
and harry is a drinker 
spot on then i didn't expect 
to be right about everything 
harry's short for harriet 
harry's your sister 
look what exactly am i supposed 
to be doing here sister 
no - seriously what am i doing 
here there's always something 
hello freak i'm here to see 
detective inspector lestrade 
why 
i was invited 
why 
i think he wants me to take a look 
well you know what i think 
don't you always sally 
i even know you didn't 
make it home last night 
i don't who's this 
colleague of mine dr watson 
dr watson sergeant sally donovan 
old friend 
a colleague() 
how do you get a colleague 
did he follow you home 
would it be better 
if i just waited no 
freak's here bringing him in 
ah anderson here we are again 
it's a crime scene i don't want it 
contaminated are we clear on that 
quite clear 
and is your wife away for long 
oh don't pretend you worked 
that out somebody told you that 
your deodorant told me that 
my deodorant 
it's for men well of course 
it's for men - i'm wearing it 
so's sergeant donovan 
ooh i think it just vaporised 
may i go in 
whatever you're trying to imply 
i'm not implying anything i'm sure 
sally came round for a nice little 
chat and just happened to stay over 
and i assume she scrubbed 
your floors going by 
the state of her knees 
you'll need to wear one of these 
who's this 
he's with me 
but who is he i said he's with me 
aren't you going to put one on 
so where are we upstairs 
i can give you two minutes 
may need longer 
her name's jennifer wilson 
according to her credit cards 
we're running them now 
for contact details 
hasn't been here long 
some kids found her 
shut up 
i didn't say anything 
you were thinking it's annoying 
got anything 
not much 
she's german 
rache it's german for revenge 
she could be trying to 
tell us something 
yes thank you for your input 
so she's german of course she's 
not she's from out of town though 
intended to stay in london 
for one night 
before returning home to cardiff 
so far so obvious 
sorry - obvious 
what about the message though 
dr watson what do you think 
of the message 
of the body you're a medical man 
we have a whole team right outside 
they won't work with me i'm breaking 
every rule letting you in here 
yesbecause you need me 
yes i do 
god help me 
dr watson hm 
oh do as he says help yourself 
anderson keep everyone out 
for a couple of minutes 
well what am i doing here 
helping me make a point i'm supposed 
to be helping you pay the rent 
this is more fun 
fun there's a woman lying dead 
perfectly sound analysis 
but i was hoping you'd go deeper 
yeah 
asphyxiation probably 
passed out choked on her own vomit 
can't smell any alcohol on her 
it could have been a seizure 
possibly drugs 
you know what it was 
you've read the papers 
well she's one of the suicides 
the fourth 
sherlock - two minutes i said 
i need anything you got 
victim is in her late 30s 
professional person 
going by her clothes - 
i'm guessing the media going by 
the frankly alarming shade of pink 
travelled from cardiff today 
intending to stay in london one night 
from the size of her suitcase 
suitcase yes she's been married 
at least ten years but not happily 
she's had a string of lovers but 
none of them knew she was married 
oh for god's sake 
if you're just making this up 
her wedding ring 
ten years old at least 
the rest of her jewellery 
has been regularly cleaned 
but not her wedding ring 
the inside 
is shinier than the outside 
the only polishing it gets 
is when she works it off her finger 
it's not for work look at her nails 
she doesn't work with her hands 
so who does she remove her rings for 
not one lover 
she'd never sustain the fiction 
of being single for that long 
so more likely a string of them 
brilliant 
sorry cardiff 
it's obvious isn't it 
it's not obvious to me 
dear god what is it like 
in your funny little brains 
it must be so boring her coat - 
it's slightly damp she's been 
in heavy rain the last few hours - 
no rain anywhere in london 
in that time 
under her coat collar is damp too 
she's turned it up against the wind 
she's got an umbrella in her pocket 
but it's dry and unused 
not just wind strong wind - 
too strong to use her umbrella 
we know from her suitcase that 
she was intending to stay overnight 
but she can't have travelled more 
than two or three hours because 
her coat still hasn't dried 
so - where has there been 
heavy rain and strong wind within 
the radius of that travel time 
cardiff 
fantastic 
do you know you do that out loud 
sorry i'll shut up 
no it'sfine 
why do you keep saying suitcase 
yes where is it 
she must have had a phone or 
an organiser find out who rachel is 
she was writing rachel 
no she was leaving an angry note 
in german - of course she was writing 
rachel no other word it can be 
why did she wait until she was dying 
to write it how do you know 
she had a suitcase 
tiny splash marks on her right heel 
and calf not present on the left 
she was dragging a wheeled suitcase 
behind her with her right hand 
by that splash pattern 
smallish case going by the spread 
case that size 
woman this clothes-conscious - 
could only be an overnight bag 
so we know she was staying one night 
where is it 
what have you done with it 
there wasn't a case 
say that again there wasn't a case 
there was never any suitcase 
suitcase did anyone find a suitcase 
was there a suitcase in this house 
sir there was no case 
but they take the poison themselves 
swallow the pills 
there are clear signs 
even you lot couldn't miss them 
right thanks and 
it's murder all of them 
i don't know how 
but they're not suicides 
they're serial killings 
we've got a serial killer there's 
always something to look forward to 
why are you saying that 
her case come on where is her case 
did she eat it() someone else 
was here and they took her case 
so the killer must have driven here 
forgot the case was in the car 
she could have checked into a hotel 
left it there 
no look at her hair 
she colour-coordinates 
her lipstick and her shoes 
she'd never have left any hotel 
with her hair still looking 
oh 
oh 
sherlock what is it what 
serial killers always hard 
you have to wait for them 
to make a mistake 
we can't just wait oh we're done 
waiting look at her really look 
houston we have a mistake 
get on to cardiff 
find out who jennifer wilson's 
family and friends were find rachel 
of course yeah - but what mistake 
pink 
anderson: let's get on with it 
he's gone who sherlock holmes 
yeah he just took off 
he does that 
is he coming back 
didn't look like it 
right 
right 
yes sorry where am i 
brixton 
do you know where i could get a cab 
it's just er 
well - 
my leg 
er 
thanks 
but you're not his friend 
he doesn't have friends 
so who are you 
i'mi'm nobody i just met him 
ok bit of advice then 
stay away from that guy 
why 
you know why he's here 
he's not paid or anything 
he likes it he gets off on it 
the weirder the crime the more 
he gets off and you know what 
one day just showing up 
won't be enough 
one day we'll be standing 
round a body and he'll be the one 
that put it there 
why would he do that 
because he's a psychopath 
psychopaths get bored 
lestrade: donovan coming 
stay away from sherlock holmes

john

have a seat john 
you know i've got a phone 
i mean very clever and all that 
but er 
you could just phone me 
on my phone 
when one is avoiding the attention 
of sherlock holmes one learns 
to be discreet hence this place 
your leg must be hurting you 
sit down 
i don't want to sit down 
you don't seem very afraid 
you don't seem very frightening 
he chuckles 
yes 
the bravery of the soldier 
bravery is by far the kindest 
word for stupidity don't you think 
what is your connection 
to sherlock holmes 
i don't have one i barely know him 
i met himyesterday 
mmm and since yesterday you've 
moved in with him and now you're 
solving crimes together 
might we expect a happy announcement 
by the end of the week 
who are you an interested party 
interested in sherlock why 
i'm guessing you're not friends 
you've met him how many friends 
do you imagine he has 
i am the closest thing to a friend 
that sherlock holmes is capable of 
having and what's that 
an enemy an enemy 
in his mind certainly 
if you were to ask him 
he'd probably say his arch-enemy 
he does love to be dramatic 
well thank god 
you're above all that 
text message alert 
i hope i'm not distracting you 
not distracting me at all 
do you plan to continue your 
association with sherlock holmes 
i could be wrong 
but i think that's 
none of your business 
it could be it really couldn't 
if you do move into erm 
i'd be happy to 
pay you a meaningful sum of money 
on a regular basis to ease your way 
why 
because you're not a wealthy man 
in exchange for what 
information 
nothing indiscreet nothing 
you'd feeluncomfortable with 
just tell me what he's up to why 
i worry about him constantly 
that's nice of you 
but i would prefer 
for various reasons 
that my concern go unmentioned 
we have what you might call a 
difficult relationship 
text message alert 
no 
but i haven't mentioned a figure 
don't bother 
you're very loyal very quickly 
no i'm not 
i'm just not interested 
what's that 
could it be that you've decided to 
trust sherlock holmes of all people 
who says i trust him you don't seem 
the kind to make friends easily 
are we done 
you tell me 
i imagine people have already 
warned you to stay away from him 
but i can see from your left hand 
that's not going to happen 
my what show me 
don't 
remarkable what is 
most peopleblunder round 
this city and all they see 
are streets and shops and cars 
when you walk with sherlock 
holmes you see the battlefield 
you've seen it already haven't you 
what's wrong with my hand 
you have an intermittent tremor 
in your left hand 
your therapist thinks it's 
post-traumatic stress disorder 
she thinks you're haunted by 
memories of your military service 
who the hell are you 
how do you know that fire her 
she's got it the wrong way round 
you're under stress right now 
and your hand is perfectly steady 
you're not haunted by the war 
dr watson 
you miss it 
welcome back 
text message alert 
time to choose a side dr watson 
i'm to take you home 
address 
er baker street 
but i need to stop off 
somewhere first 
listen your boss 
any chance you could not tell him 
this is where i went 
sure you've told him 
already haven't you 
yeah 
hey erm 
do you ever get any free time 
she chuckles 
oh yeah lots 
bye ok 
he exhales slowly 
what are you doing 
nicotine patch 
helps me think 
impossible to sustain a smoking 
habit in london these days 
bad news for brain work 
it's good news for breathing 
oh breathing breathing's boring 
is thatthree patches 
it's a three-patch problem 
well 
you asked me to come 
i'm assuming it's important 
oh - yeah of course 
can i borrow your phone 
my phone always a chance 
that my number will be recognised 
it's on the website 
mrs hudson's got a phone 
yeah she's downstairs 
i tried shouting but she didn't hear 
i was the other side of london 
there was no hurry 
here 
so what's this about - the case 
her case her case 
her suitcase yes obviously 
the murderer took her suitcase 
first big mistake 
ok he took her case so 
it's no use there's no other way 
we'll have to risk it 
on my desk there's a number 
i want you to send a text 
you've brought me here 
to send a text 
text yes the number on my desk 
what's wrong 
just met a friend of yours 
a friend an enemy 
oh which one 
well your arch-enemy according to 
him do people have arch-enemies 
did he offer you money to spy on me 
yes did you take it 
no pity we could have split the 
fee think it through next time 
who is he 
the most dangerous man you've ever 
met and not my problem right now 
on my desk the number 
jennifer wilson that was 
hang on wasn't that the dead woman 
yes that's not important 
just enter the number 
are you doing it yes 
have you done it 
yeah - hang on 
these words exactly 
please come" you blacked out 
what no no 
type and send it quickly 
have you sent it what's the address 
that's 
that's the pink lady's case 
that's jennifer wilson's case 
yes obviously 
oh perhaps i should mention - 
i didn't kill her 
i never said you did 
why not given that text 
and the fact i have her case 
it's a perfectly logical assumption 
do people usually assume 
you're the murderer 
now and then yes 
ok 
how did you get this by looking 
where the killer must have 
driven her to lauriston gardens 
he could only keep her case 
by accident if it was in the car 
nobody could be seen with this case 
without drawing attention - 
particularly a man 
which is statistically more likely 
so obviously he'd feel compelled 
to get rid of it 
wouldn't have taken him more than 
five minutes to realise his mistake 
i checked every backstreet 
wide enough for a car 
five minutes from lauriston gardens 
bulky object without being observed 
to find the right skip' 
pink you got all that because 
you realised the case would be pink 
it had to be pink obviously 
why didn't i think of that() 
because you're an idiot 
no no no don't look like that 
practically everyone is 
now look do you see what's missing 
from the case how could i 
her phone where's her mobile phone 
there was no phone on the body 
there's no phone in the case 
we know she had one 
you just texted it 
maybe she left it at home 
she has a string of lovers 
and she's careful about it 
she never leaves her phone at home 
er 
why did i just send that text 
well the question is 
where is her phone now 
she could have lost it yes or 
the murderer you think 
the murderer has the phone 
maybe sheleft it 
when she left her case maybe 
he took it from her for some reason 
either way 
the balance of probability is 
the murderer has her phone 
sorrywhat are we doing - 
did i just text a murderer 
what good will that do 
text message alert 
a few hours after his last victim 
and now he receives a text 
that can only be from her 
if somebody had just found that phone 
they'd ignore a text like that 
but the murderer 
would panic 
have you talked to the police four 
people are dead there isn't time 
so why are you talking to me 
mrs hudson took my skull 
so i'm basically filling in 
for your skull 
relax you're doing fine 
well well what well - you could 
just sit there andwatch telly 
what you want me to come with you 
i like company when i go out 
and i think better when i talk aloud 
the skull just 
attracts attention so 
problem yeah sergeant donovan 
what about her 
she said 
you get off on this you enjoy it 
and i said "dangerous" 
and here you are 
damn it 
where are we going 
northumberland street's 
a five-minute walk from here 
you think he's stupid enough 
to go there 
no - i think he's brilliant enough 
i love the brilliant ones they're 
all so desperate to get caught 
why appreciation 
applause at long last the spotlight 
that's the frailty of genius john 
it needs an audience yeah 
this is his hunting ground 
right here in the heart of the city 
now that we know his victims were 
abducted that changes everything 
because all of his victims 
disappeared from busy streets 
crowded places 
but nobody saw them go 
think who do we trust 
even though we don't know them 
who passes unnoticed 
wherever they go 
who hunts in the middle of a crowd 
don't know who 
haven't the faintest hungry 
thank you billy 
keep your eyes on it 
he's not just going to ring 
the doorbell he'd need to be mad 
he has killed four people 
ok 
sherlock 
anything on the menu 
whatever you want free 
on the house for you 
and for your date 
do you want to eat i'm not his date 
this man got me off a murder charge 
this is angelo three years ago 
i proved to lestrade at the time of 
a particularly vicious triple murder 
that angelo was elsewhere 
house-breaking 
he cleared my name i cleared it 
a bit anything happening opposite 
nothing 
but for this man i'd have gone 
to prison you did go to prison 
i'll get a candle for the table 
it's more romantic 
i'm not his date 
you may as well eat 
we might have a long wait 
thanks 
people don't have arch-enemies 
i'm sorry in real life 
there are no arch-enemies 
in real life doesn't happen 
doesn't it sounds a bit dull 
so who did i meet 
what do real people have then 
in their"real lives" 
friends 
people they know people they like 
people they don't like 
girlfriends boyfriends 
yes well as i was saying - dull 
you don't have a girlfriend then 
girlfriend no not really my area 
mm 
oh right 
do you have aboyfriend 
which is fine by the way 
i know it's fine 
so you've got a boyfriend then no 
right ok 
you're unattached like me 
fine good 
john erm 
i think you should know that 
i consider myself married to my work 
and while i'm flattered 
i'm really not looking for any no 
i'mnot asking no 
i'm just saying it's all fine 
taxi outside

police open her up 
sherlock pants

teeth tan what - californian 
la santa monica just arrived 
how could you possibly know that 
the luggage 
probably your first trip 
to london right 
going by your final destination 
and the cabbie's route 
sorry - are you guys the police 
yeah everything all right 
yeah 
welcome to london 
er any problems - just let us know 
basically just a cab that 
happened to slow down basically 
not the murderer 
not the murderer no 
wrong country good alibi 
as they go 
hey where did you get this 
detective inspector lestrade yeah 
i pickpocket him when he's annoying 
you can keep that one 
i've got plenty at the flat 
what 
nothing just"welcome to london" 
he sniggers 
got your breath back 
ready when you are 
john pants 
ok 
that was ridiculous 
that was the most 
ridiculous thingi've ever done 
and you invaded afghanistan 
they laugh 
that wasn't just me 
why aren't we back 
at the restaurant 
they can keep an eye out 
it was a long shot anyway 
so what were we doing there 
oh just passing the time 
and proving a point 
what point you 
mrs hudson dr watson 
will take the room upstairs 
says who 
says the man at the door 
knocking 
sherlock texted me 
he said you forgot this 
ah 
er thank you 
thank you 
sherlock what have you done 
mrs hudson upstairs 
what are you doing well i knew 
you'd find the case i'm not stupid 
you can't just break into my flat 
you can't withhold evidence - 
and i didn't break in 
well what do you call this then 
it's a drugs bust 
seriously this guy - a junkie 
have you met him john 
you could search this flat all day 
you wouldn't find anything 
you could call recreational 
john you probably want to 
shut up now but come on 
no what 
you 
shut up i'm not your sniffer dog 
no anderson's my sniffer dog 
anderson what are you doing here 
on a drugs bust 
oh i volunteered they all did 
they're not strictly speaking on the 
drug squad but they're very keen 
are these human eyes 
put those back 
they were in the microwave 
it's an experiment 
keep looking guys 
or you could help us properly 
and i'll stand them down 
this is childish 
well i'm dealing with a child 
sherlock this is our case 
i'm letting you in 
but you do not go off on your own 
clear what - so you set up 
a pretend drugs bust to bully me 
it stops being pretend 
if we find anything i am clean 
is your flat all of it 
don't even smoke 
neither do i 
so let's work together 
we've found rachel who is she 
jennifer wilson's only daughter 
her daughter 
why would she write 
her daughter's name why 
never mind that we found the case 
according to someone the murderer 
has the case and we found it in the 
hands of our favourite psychopath 
i'm a high-functioning sociopath 
do your research 
you need to bring rachel in 
and i need to question her 
she's dead excellent 
how when and why is there 
a connection there has to be 
well i doubt it 
since she's been dead for 14 years 
technically she was never alive 
rachel was jennifer wilson's 
stillborn daughter 14 years ago 
no that's 
why would she do that why 
why would she think of her daughter 
in her last moments yup - 
sociopath i'm seeing it now 
she didn't think about her daughter 
she scratched her name on the floor 
with her fingernails she was dying 
it took effort it would have hurt 
you said that the victims 
all took the poison themselves 
that he makes them take it - 
well maybe hei don't know 
talks to them maybe he used 
the death of her daughter somehow 
yeah but that was ages ago 
why would she still be upset 
not good 
bit not good yeah 
if you were dying 
if you'd been murdered - in your very 
last few seconds what would you say 
use your imagination 
i don't have to 
yeah but if you were clever 
jennifer wilson running 
all those lovers - she was clever 
she's trying to tell us something 
isn't the doorbell working 
your taxi's here sherlock 
i didn't order a taxi go away 
oh dear they're making such 
a mess what are they looking for 
it's a drugs bust mrs hudson 
but they're just for my hip 
they're herbal soothers 
shut up everybody don't speak 
don't breathe i'm trying to think 
anderson face the other way 
you're putting me off 
what my face is() 
everybody quiet and still 
anderson turn your back 
oh for god's sake 
your back now please 
come on think quick 
what about your taxi 
mrs hudson 
oh 
ah 
she was clever clever yes 
she's cleverer than you lot and she's 
dead do you see do you get it 
she didn't lose her phone she 
never lost it she planted it on him 
when she got out of the car she 
knew that she was going to her death 
she left the phone in order to 
lead us to her killer but how 
what do you mean how 
rachel 
don't you see rachel 
oh 
look at you lot 
you're all so vacant 
is it nice not being me 
it must be so relaxing 
rachel is not a name 
then what is it john - 
on the luggage there's a label 
e-mail address 
er jenniepink@mephoneorguk 
she didn't have a laptop which means 
she did her business on her phone 
a smartphone it's e-mail enabled 
so there was a website 
for her account 
the username is her e-mail address - 
and all together the password is 
rachel 
so we can read her e-mails so what 
anderson don't talk out loud 
you lower the iq of the whole street 
we can do much more than that 
it's a smartphone it's got gps 
which means if you lose it you can 
locate it online she's leading us 
directly to the man who killed her 
unless he got rid of it 
we know he didn't 
come on come on quickly 
sherlock dear this taxi driver 
mrs hudson isn't it time 
for your evening soother 
get vehicles get a helicopter this 
phone battery won't last for ever 
we'll just have a map reference 
not a name it's a start 
sherlock narrows it down 
from just anyone in london 
it's the first proper lead 
that we've had sherlock 
where is it quickly where 
here it'sin 221 baker street 
how can it be here 
how 
maybe it was in the case 
when you brought it back 
and itfell out somewhere 
what and i didn't notice it 
me - i didn't notice 
anyway we texted him 
and he called back 
guys we're also looking 
for a mobile somewhere here 
belonged to the victim 'who do we 
trust even if we don't know them 
wherever they go 
text message alert 
sherlock you ok what 
yeah yeah i'm fine 
so how can the phone be here 
don't know 
i'll try it again good idea 
where are you going 
fresh air just popping outside 
for a moment won't be long 
you sure you're all right i'm fine 
taxi for sherlock holmes 
i didn't order a taxi 
doesn't mean you don't need one 
you're the cabbie 
the one who stopped outside 
northumberland street 
it was you not your passenger 
see 
no-one ever thinks about the cabbie 
it's like you're invisible 
just the back of an 'ead 
proper advantage 
for a serial killer 
is this a confession oh yeah 
i'll tell you what else 
if you call the coppers now 
i won't run 
i'll sit quiet and they can 
take me down i promise 
why 
cos you're not going to do that 
am i not 
i didn't kill those four people 
mr holmes 
i spoke to 'em 
and they killed themselves 
if you get the coppers now 
i'll promise you one thing 
i will never tell you what i said 
no-one else will die though and 
i believe they call that a result 
and you won't ever understand 
how those people died 
what kind of result 
do you care about 
if i wanted to understand 
let me take you for a ride 
so you can kill me too 
i don't want to kill you mr holmes 
i'm going to talk to ya 
going to kill yourself 
door opens and closes 
engine starts 
he just got in a cab 
it's sherlock 
he just drove off in a cab 
i told you he does that 
he bloody left again 
we're wasting our time 
i'mcalling the phone 
it's ringing out 
phone rings 
phone keeps ringing 
phone keeps ringing 
and if it's ringing it's not here 
i'll try the search again

he's just a lunatic and he'll 
always let you down and you're 
wasting your time all our time 
ok everybody 
done here 
how did you find me 
oh i recognised ya 
soon as i saw you chasing my cab 
sherlock holmes 
i was warned about you 
i've been on your website too 
brilliant stuff loved it 
who warned you about me just 
someone out there who's noticed 
who 
who would notice me 
you're too modest mr holmes 
i'm really not 
got yourself a fan 
tell me more 
that's all you're going to know 
in this lifetime 
why did he do that 
why did he have to leave 
you know him better than i do 
i've known him for five years - 
and no i don't 
so why do you put up with him 
because i'm desperate that's why 
and because sherlock holmes 
is a great man - 
and i think one day 
if we're very very lucky 
he might even be a good one 
where are we 
you know every street in london 
you know exactly where we are 
roland-kerr 
further education college 
why here it's open 
cleaners are in 
one thing about being a cabbie -

a nice quiet spot for a murder 
i'm surprised more of us 
don't branch out 
and you just walk your victims in 
how 
oh dull 
don't worry it gets better 
you can't make people take 
their own lives at gunpoint i don't 
it's much better than that 
don't need this with you 
cos you'll follow me 
beep 
continued beeping 
well what do you think 
it's up to you 
you're the one 
who's going to die here 
no i'm not 
that's what they all say 
shall we talk 
bit risky wasn't it 
took me away under the eye of 
about half a dozen policemen 
they're not that stupid 
and mrs hudson will remember you 
you call that a risk nah 
this is a risk 
oh i like this bit 
cos you don't get it yet do ya 
but you're about to 
i just have to do this 
weren't expecting that were ya 
oh you're going to love this 
love what 
sherlock holmes look at you 
here in the flesh that website 
of yours your fan told me about it 
my fan 
you are brilliant 
you are a proper genius 
the science of deduction 
now that 
is proper thinking 
between you and me sitting here 
why can't people think 
don't it make you mad 
why can't people just think 
oh i see 
so you're a proper genius too 
don't look it do i 
funny little man driving a cab 
but you'll know better in a minute 
chances are it'll be 
the last thing you ever know 
ok two bottles explain 
there's a good bottle 
and a bad bottle 
you take the pill from 
the good bottle you live 
you take the pill from 
the bad bottleyou die 
both bottles are of course identical 
in every way 
and you know which is which 
of course i know but i don't 
wouldn't be a game if you knew 
you're the one who chooses 
why should i i've got nothing 
to go on what's in it for me 
i haven't told you the best bit yet 
whatever bottle you choose 
i take the pill from the other one 
and then together 
we take our medicine 
i won't cheat it's your choice 
i'll take whatever pill you don't 
didn't expect that 
did you mr holmes 
this is what you did 
to the rest of them - 
you gave them a choice 
and now i'm giving you one 
you take your time 
get yourself together 
i want your best game 
it's not a game it's chance 
i've played four times i'm alive 
it's not chance mr holmes 
it's chess 
it's a game of chess 
with one moveand one survivor 
and this - this 
is the move 
did i just give you the good bottle 
or the bad bottle 
you can choose either one 
no detective inspector lestrade - 
i need to speak to him 
it's important it's an emergency 
er left here please left here 
you ready yet mr holmes 
ready to play play what 
it's a 50:50 chance 
you're not playing the numbers 
you're playing me 
did i just give you the good pill 
or the bad pill 
is it a bluff 
or a double bluff 
or a triple bluff 
it's still just chance 
four people in a row 
it's not chance 
luck it's genius 
i know how people think 
i know how people think i think 
i can see it all 
like a map inside my head 
everyone's so stupid even you 
or maybe god just loves me 
either way 
you're wasted as a cabbie 
so 
you risked your life four times 
just to kill strangers why 
time to play 
oh i am playing 
this is my turn 
there's shaving foam behind your left 
ear nobody's pointed it out to you 
traces of where it's happened before 
so obviously you live on your own - 
there's no-one to tell you 
but there's a photograph of children 
their mother's been cut out 
if she'd died she'd still be there 
the photograph's old 
but the frame's new 
you think of your children 
but you don't get to see them 
estranged father 
she took the kids 
but you still love them 
and it still hurts 
ah but there's more 
your clothes recently laundered 
but everything you're wearing 
is at leastthree years old 
keeping up appearances 
but not planning ahead 
and here you are on a kamikaze 
murder spree what's that about 
ah 
three years ago 
is that when they told you 
told me what 
that you're a dead man walking 
so are you 
you don't have long though 
am i right 
aneurism right in 'ere 
any breath could be my last 
and because you're dying 
you've just murdered four people 
i've outlived four people 
that's the most fun you can have 
with an aneurism 
no no there's something else 
you didn't just kill four people 
because you're bitter 
bitterness is a paralytic 
love 
is a much more vicious motivator 
somehow this is about your children 
oh 
you are good in't ya but how 
when i die they won't get much 
my kids 
not a lot of money in driving cabs 
or serial killing 
you'd be surprised 
surprise me 
i have a sponsor 
you have a what for every life 
i take money goes to my kids 
the more i kill 
the better off they'll be 
you see it's nicer than you think 
who'd sponsor a serial killer 
who'd be a fan of sherlock holmes 
you're not the only one 
to enjoy a good murder 
there's others out there just 
like you except you're just a man 
and they're so much more than that 
what do you mean 
more than a man 
an organisation what 
there's a name that no-one says 
and i'm not going to say it either 
now enough chatter 
time to choose 
sherlock 
sherlock 
what if i don't choose either 
i could just walk out of here 
you can take a 50:50 chance 
or i can shoot you in the head 
funnily enough 
no-one's ever gone for that option 
i'll have the gun please 
are you sure 
definitely the gun 
you don't want to phone a friend() 
the gun 
i know a real gun when i see one 
none of the others did clearly 
well this has been very interesting 
i look forward to the court case 
just before you go 
did you figure it out 
which one's the good bottle 
course child's play 
well which one then 
which one would you have picked 
just so i know whether 
i could have beaten you 
come on 
play the game 
oh 
interesting 
so what do you think 
shall we 
really what do you think 
can you beat me 
are you clever enough 
faintly: sherlock 
i bet you get bored don't you 
i know you do 
a man like you so clever 
but what's the point of being clever 
if you can't prove it 
still the addict 
but thisthis is what 
you're really addicted to 
you'll do anything 
to stop being bored 
you're not bored now are ya 
isn't it good 
gunshot 
cabbie gasps 
was i right 
i was wasn't i 
did i get it right 
ok tell me this 
your sponsor who was it 
the one who told you about me 
my fan 
i want a name 
no 
you're dying 
but there's still time to hurt you 
give mea name 
he gasps 
a name now 
the name 
he gasps 
moriarty 
sirens wail 
why have i got this blanket 
they keep putting this blanket on me 
yeah it's for shock 
i'm not in shock 
yeah but some of the guys 
want to take photographs 
so the shooter no sign 
cleared off before we got here 
but a guy like that 
would have had enemies i suppose 
one of them could have 
been following him but 
we've got nothing to go on 
oh i wouldn't say that 
ok give me 
the bullet they just dug 
out of the wall's from a handgun 
a kill shot over that distance 
that's a crack shot 
but not just a marksman a fighter 
his hands couldn't have shaken at all 
so clearly he's acclimatised 
to violence 
he didn't fire until i was 
in immediate danger though 
so strong moral principle 
you're looking for a man 
probably with a history 
of military service and 
nerves of steel 
actually do you know what 
ignore me sorry ignore all of that 
it's just the erthe shock talking 
where are you going i just 
need totalk about the rent 
i've still got questions 
what now i'm in shock - 
look i've got a blanket 
sherlock and i just caught you 
a serial killer more or less 
ok we'll pull you in tomorrow 
off you go 
erm - sergeant donovan has 
just been explaining everything 
the two pills 
dreadful business isn't it 
dreadful 
good shot 
yes yes must have been through 
that window well you'd know 
need to get the powder burns 
out of your fingers 
i don't suppose you'd serve time for 
this but let's avoid the court case 
are you all right 
yes of course i'm all right 
well you have just killed a man 
yes 
that's true isn't it 
but he wasn't a very nice man 
no no he wasn't really was he 
frankly a bloody awful cabbie 
sherlock chuckles 
that's true he was a bad cabbie 
you should have seen 
the route he took us to get here 
stop it we can't giggle 
it's a crime scene stop it 
well you're the one who shot him 
keep your voice down 
sorry it's just erm 
nerves i think sorry 
you were going to take that damn 
pill weren't you course i wasn't 
biding my time knew you'd turn up 
no you didn't 
that's how you get your kicks 
isn't it - you risk your life 
to prove you're clever 
why would i do that 
because you're an idiot 
dinner starving 
end of baker street there's 
a good chinese stays open till two 
you can tell a good chinese by the 
bottom third of the door handle 
sherlock that's him that's 
the man i was talking to you about 
i know exactly who that is 
so another case cracked 
how very public-spirited 
though that's never really 
your motivation is it 
what are you doing here 
as ever i'm concerned about you 
yes i've been hearing 
about your "concern" 
always so aggressive 
did it never occur to you that 
you and i belong on the same side 
oddly enough - no 
we have more in common 
than you'd like to believe 
this petty feud between us 
is simply childish 
people will suffer and you know 
how it always upset mummy 
i upset her 
me 
it wasn't me that upset her mycroft 
no no wait 
mummy who's mummy 
mother our mother 
this is my brother mycroft 
putting on weight again 
losing it in fact 
he's your brother 
course he's my brother 
so he's not not what 
i don't know criminal mastermind 
close enough for goodness' sake 
i occupy a minor position 
in the british government 
he is the british government 
when he's not too busy being 
the british secret service 
or the cia on a freelance basis 
good evening mycroft try not 
to start a war before i get home 
you know what it does 
for the traffic 
so when you say you're 
concerned about him - 
you actually are concerned 
yes of course 
i mean it actually is 
a childish feud 
he's always been so resentful 
you can imagine 
the christmas dinners yeah 
no god no 
i'd better erm 
hello again 
hello 
we met earlier on this evening 
oh ok goodnight 
goodnight dr watson 
so dim sum mmm

moriarty 
what's moriarty

sir shall we go 
interesting that soldier fellow 
he could be the making 
of my brother

no chance for you to be a 
hero this time mr holmes 
oh do your research 
i'm not a hero 
i'm a high-functioning sociopath 
merry christmas 
i'm not given to outbursts 
of brotherly compassion 
you know what happened to the other one 
miss me 
miss me did you miss me' 
i've only been gone four minutes 
well i certainly hope 
you've learnt your lesson 
what you're about to see is 
classified beyond top secret 
is that quite clear 
don't minute any of this 
once beyond these walls 
you must never speak of it 
a d notice has been slapped 
on the entire incident 
only those within this room 
code names antarctica 
langdale porlock and love 
will ever know the whole truth 
as far as everyone else is concerned 
going to the prime minister 
and way beyond charles augustus 
why would i be tweeting 
what are you doing 
will you take this matter 
seriously sherlock 
i am taking it seriously what makes 
you think i'm not taking it seriously 
look not so long ago i was on a 
mission that meant certain death - 
my death 
and now i'm back in a nice warm 
office with my big brother and 
are those ginger nuts 
our doctor said you were clean 
i am utterly 
no need for stimulants now 
remember i have work to do 
you're high as a kite 
natural high i assure you 
totally natural 
i'm just ♪ glad to be alive ♪ 
what shall we do next what's your name 
vivian 
well it's a lovely day go for a stroll 
make a paper aeroplane have an ice lolly 
ice lolly i suppose 
ice lolly it is 
i'm a high-functioning sociopath 
i see who is supposed to have 
shot him then 
some over-eager squaddie with an 
itchy trigger finger - that's who 
remarkable how did you do it 
we have some very talented 
people working here 
if james moriarty can hack 
every tv screen in the land 
rest assured we have the tech to 
doctor a bit of security footage 
that is now the official version 
the version anyone we want to will see 
no need to go to the trouble of getting 
some sort of official pardon 
you're off the hook mr holmes 
you're home and dry 
ok cheers 
obviously there's unfinished business 
moriarty 
i told you - moriarty's dead 
you say he filmed that video 
message before he died 
yes 
you also say you know what 
he's going to do next 
perhaps he was just 
trying to frighten you 
no no he would never 
be that disappointing 
he's planned something 
something long-term 
something that would take 
effect if he never made it 
off that rooftop alive 
posthumous revenge 
no better than that - posthumous game 
we brought you back to deal with this 
wait 
of course wait 
i'm the target - targets wait 
look whatever's coming 
whatever he's lined up 
i'll know when it begins 
i always know when the game is on 
do you know why 
why 
because i love it 
there was once a merchant 
in the famous market at baghdad 
one day he saw a stranger 
looking at him in surprise 
and he knew that the stranger was death 
pale and trembling 
the merchant fled the marketplace 
and made his way many many miles 
to the city of samarra 
for there he was sure 
death could not find him 
but when at last he came to samarra 
the merchant saw waiting for him 
the grim figure of death 
when you saw me this 
morning in baghdad" 
if this gets any better 
i'm going to get two knives 
pays to advertise 
i'm going to monitor the underworld 
every quiver of the web will tell 
me when the spider makes his move 
so basically 
your plan is just to sit there 
solving crimes like you always do 
awesome isn't it 
he drowned mr holmes 
that's what we thought 
superficial 
come back it's the wrong thumb 
_ 
hopkins arrest wilson 
dimmock look in the lymph nodes 
yes you may have nothing but 
a limbless torso but there'll 
be traces of ink in the lymph 
nodes under the armpits 
if your mystery corpse had tattoos 
the signs will be there 
the canary trainer' 
hm naturally 
sherlock you can't go 
on spinning plates like this 
that's it the place was spinning 
the heart medication you're taking 
is known to cause bouts of amnesia 
yes i i think so why 
because the fingerprints on your 
brother's neck were your own 
you can't arrest a jellyfish 
oh 
we're in a lot of trouble 
ow oh my god oh my god 
relax it's got two syllables 
i'm a nurse darling - 
i think i know what to do 
no just drive please god 
just drive god drive 
sherlock - mary 
that's it mary - re 
john john i think 
you have to pull over 
oh my god

let's have a look 
aw she's so beautiful 
have we 
molly mrs h we would 
love you to be godparents 
that's so lovely 
and uh you too sherlock 
god is a ludicrous fiction 
dreamt up by inadequates 
who abnegate all responsibility 
to an invisible magic friend 
yeah but there'll be cake will you do it 
i'll get back to you 
father we ask you to send 
your blessings on this water 
and sanctify it for our use this day 
in christ's name 
now what name have you 
given your daughter 
rosamund mary 
rosamund 
it means "rose of the world" 
rosie for short 
didn't you get john's text 
no i delete his texts 
i delete any text that begins "hi" 
no idea why people think you're 
incapable of human emotion 
sorry 
phone 
and now godparents are you ready 
to help the parents of this child 
in their duties as christian parents 
we are 
as ever watson you 
see but do not observe 
to you the world remains 
an impenetrable mystery 
whereas to me it is an open book 
hard logic versus romantic whimsy - 
that is your choice 
you fail to connect actions 
to their consequences 
now for the last time 
if you want to keep the rattle 
do not throw the rattle 
all right good girl 
good girl good girl 
i'd better finish this hadn't i 
he says you've got a good one greg 
oh yeah 
it was david welsborough's 50th birthday 
god 50 
where does it go 
i know for a fact i was 
only 21 this time last week 
yeah well that's impossible 
that was before you met me 
she's looking at me disapprovingly again 
no she's just jealous 
yeah well i think we both are 
oh no oh it's a skype call 
oh then it must be charlie 
at least he's phoning i suppose 
oh look hello 
sorry to miss the party 
but travel broadens the mind right' 
no picture's frozen 
but i can still hear you' 
why is it rubbish where are you 
how is he is he eating 
ask him if he's eating 
david come on 
ok no hang on a sec 
i'll find somewhere quieter 
so charlie where are you 
are you there 
just the altitude' 
altitude 
you see the mountains' 
never mind mountains 
your mother wants to know 
if you're eating properly 
something on my car' 
your car 
the guys here don't believe 
i've got a power ranger 
stuck to the bonnet 
all done have you got it 
charlie 
a week later 
yeah 
drunk driver he's totally smashed 
the cops are chasing him 
and he turns into the drive 
of the welsborough house 
to try and get away 
unfortunately 
the drunk guy survived 
they managed to pull him out 
but when they put the fire out 
and examined the parked car 
whose body 
charlie welsborough the son 
dna all checks out 
night of the party the car's empty 
and a week later 
the dead boy's found at the wheel 
yeah charlie welsborough's 
the son of a cabinet minister 
so i'm under a lot of 
pressure to get a result 
who cares about that 
tell me about the seats 
made of vinyl 
two different types of vinyl present 
was it his own car 
yeah not flash - he was a student 
according to this 
charlie welsborough had 
already been dead for a week 
what 
the body in the car dead for a week 
oh this is a good one is it my birthday 
you want help 
take all the credit it gets 
boring if i just solve them all 
yeah you say that 
but then john blogs about it 
and you get all the credit anyway 
he's got a point 
which makes me look like 
some kind of prima donna 
who insists on getting credit 
for something he didn't do 
well i think you've hit a 
sore spot sherlock 
so you take all the glory thanks 
look just solve the bloody thing 
will you it's driving me nuts 
anything you say giles 
just kidding 
what's his name 
greg what 
greg 
it's obvious though 
isn't it what happened 
john you amaze me 
you know what happened 
not a clue it's just you 
normally say that at this point 
hmm well then let's hope you 
solve your little problem greg 
you're at the beck and call of a 
screaming demanding baby 
woken up at all hours 
to obey its every whim 
yes well you know how it is 
all you do is clean up their mess 
pat them on the head 
can't even tell people's faces apart 
this is a joke isn't it 
yeah and it's all "oh aren't you 
clever you're so so clever" 
you know i think that 
really might be it 
no don't get it 
charlie's family are pretty cut 
up about it as you'd expect 
so go easy on them yeah 
yeah got them don't worry 
pampers the cream you 
can't get from boots 
yeah never mind about that 
where are you now 
well i texted you the details 
yeah two different types of vinyl 
a receptionist picks up' 
i'm working on it 
slowing you down' 
has a week-old corpse in it 
going to call this one' 
oh the ghost driver 
no never do that - people are stupid 
uh some people 
most people' 
isn't it to be him' 
i mean it's right up your strasse 
mr and mrs welsborough 
i really am most terribly sorry 
to hear about your daughter 
mr and mrs welsborough 
this is mr sherlock holmes 
thank you very much for coming 
we've heard a great deal about you 
if anyone can throw any light into 
this darkness surely it will be you 
well i believe that i 
but charlie was our 
whole world mr holmes i 
sherlock 
mr holmes 
sorry you were saying 
well charlie was our 
whole world mr holmes 
i i don't think we'll 
ever get over this 
no shouldn't think so 
so sorry will you excuse 
me a moment i just 
i'll i'll just um ahem 
by the pricking of my thumbs 
seriously you 
intuitions are not to be ignored john 
they represent data processed too fast 
for the conscious mind to comprehend 
what is this 
oh it's a sort of shrine 
i suppose really 
bit of a fan of mrs t 
a big hero of mine when 
i was getting started 
right yes 
the first female prime 
minister of this country 
right 
you know perfectly well who she is 
why are you playing for time 
it's the gap look at the gap it's wrong 
everything else is perfectly 
ordered managed 
the whole thing's verging on ocd 
my respects 
this figurine is routinely 
repositioned after 
the cleaner's been in 
this picture is straightened every day 
yet this ugly gap remains 
but only recently - yes a 
what the hell has this 
got to do with charlie 
well how could it get broken 
the only place for it to fall is the 
floor and there is a big thick rug 
no he's an arsehole 
but it's an easy mistake 
look no we had a break-in 
some little bastard smashed it to bits 
we found the remains 
out there in the porch 
they'd go to the trouble 
of smashing her likeness 
i'm no expert 
but uh possibly her face 
why didn't he smash all the others 
perfect opportunity 
and look at that one - she's smiling 
oh inspector 
this is clearly a waste of time 
you do 
it's quite simple 
superficial to be blunt 
but first tell me 
the night of the break-in 
this room was in darkness 
i noticed the motion sensor was damaged 
i lack the arrogance to ignore details 
i'm not the police 
where he could see it - exactly 
mr holmes please 
it was your 50th birthday 
mr welsborough of course you were 
disappointed that your son hadn't 
made it back from his gap year 
the first part of your conversation was 
in fact pre-recorded video 
easily arranged 
it's a skype call 
the trick was meant to be a surprise 
could you take a photo and send it 
there were two types of vinyl in 
the burnt-out remains of the car 
one the actual passenger seat 
the other a good copy 
well good enough 
effectively a costume 
you're joking 
no i'm not 
all he wanted was for you to 
get close enough to the car 
so he could spring the surprise 
that's when it happened 
i can't be certain of course 
but i think charlie must have 
suffered some sort of a seizure 
you said he'd felt unwell 
you all right 
just the altitude' 
he died there and then 
no-one had any cause to go near his car 
so there he remained 
in the driver's seat hidden until 
when the two cars were examined 
the fake seat had melted in 
the fire revealing charlie 
who'd been sitting there 
quite dead for a week 
oh god 
poor kid 
really i'm so sorry 
mr welsborough mrs welsborough 
this is where it was smashed 
the car the kid 
ancient history 
why are you still talking about it 
what's so important about a 
broken bust of margaret thatcher 
i can't stand it never can 
there's a loose thread in the world 
it doesn't mean you have to pull on it 
what kind of a life would that be 
besides i have the strangest feeling 
miss me 
i need to concentrate 
and i don't want to hit you 
the mall please 
rather arrogant i thought 
why am i looking at this 
that's her john and mary's baby 
oh i see yes 
looks very fully functioning 
is that really the best you can do 
sorry i've never been 
very good with them 
moriarty - did he have 
any connection with thatcher 
any interest in her 
why on earth would he 
i don't know you tell me 
in the last year of his life 
james moriarty was involved with 
four political assassinations 
over 70 assorted robberies 
and terrorist attacks 
including a chemical weapons 
factory in north korea 
and had latterly shown some interest 
in tracking down the black 
pearl of the borgias 
which is still missing by the way 
in case you feel like applying 
yourself to something practical 
it's a pearl - get another one 
there's something important about this 
i'm sure 
maybe it's moriarty 
maybe it's not 
but something's coming 
are you having a premonition 
brother mine 
the world is woven from billions of lives 
every strand crossing every other 
what we call premonition is 
just movement of the web 
if you could attenuate to 
every strand of quivering data 
the future would be entirely calculable 
as inevitable as mathematics 
the merchant who can't outrun death 
you always hated that story as a child 
less keen on predestination back then 
i'm not sure i like it now 
you wrote your own 
version as i remember 
appointment in sumatra 
the merchant goes to a different 
city and is perfectly fine 
goodnight mycroft 
then he becomes a pirate for some reason 
absolutely no idea 
you uh 
uh you see a lot of each other do you 
it's nothing i mean 
it's nothing serious 
now and again for a chat 
yeah of course 
i mean he loves a really tricky case 
yeah he does 
so what you here for 
well interpol think 
the borgia pearl trail 
leads back to london so 
the borgia pearl 
they still after that are they 
yeah 
so how did you two first meet 
oh well there was a case about 
um ten years ago 
nobody could figure it out 
there was an old lady 
found dead in a sauna 
what 
i know but then i met sherlock 
it was so simple the way 
will you two please keep it down 
now you haven't always been 
in life insurance have you 
you started out in manual labour 
don't bother being astonished 
your right hand's almost 
an entire size bigger 
than your left - hard 
manual work does that 
i was a carpenter like me dad 
you're trying to give up smoking - 
unsuccessfully - 
and you once had a japanese girlfriend 
that meant a lot to you but 
now you feel indifferent about 
how the hell 
ah e-cigarettes 
not just that - ten 
individual e-cigarettes 
if you just wanted to smoke indoors 
you would've invested 
in one of those irritating 
electronic pipe things 
but you're convinced you can give up 
so you don't want to buy a pipe 
because that means you're 
not serious about quitting 
so instead you buy individual cigarettes 
always sure that each will be 
your last anything to add john 
well it's a me substitute 
don't be so hard on yourself 
you know i value your 
little contributions 
yeah it's been there 
since nine this morning 
what about my girlfriend 
you've got a japanese tattoo 
in the crook of your elbow 
in the name akako 
it's obvious you've 
tried to have it removed 
but surely that means 
i want to forget her 
not that i'm indifferent 
if she'd really hurt your feelings 
you would've had the word obliterated 
the first attempt wasn't successful 
and you haven't tried again 
so it seems you can 
live with the slightly 
blurred memory of akako 
hence the indifference 
i i thought you'd 
done something clever 
ah now but now you've explained it 
it's dead simple innit 
i've withheld this information 
from you until now mr kingsley 
but i think it's time you knew the truth 
what do you mean 
have you ever wondered if your wife 
was a little bit out of your league 
i'm afraid it's far worse than that 
your wife is a spy 
her real name is greta bengsdotter 
swedish by birth and probably the 
most dangerous spy in the world 
she's been operating deep undercover 
for the past four years now 
as your wife for one reason only 
to get near the american embassy 
across the road from your flat 
tomorrow the us president 
will be at the embassy 
as part of an official state visit 
as the president greets members 
of staff greta bengsdotter 
disguised as a 22-stone cleaner 
will inject the president 
in the back of the neck 
with a dangerous new drug 
hidden inside a secret compartment 
inside her padded armpit 
this drug will render the 
president entirely susceptible 
to the will of that new master 
none other than james moriarty 
what 
moriarty will then use 
the president as a pawn 
to destabilise the united 
nations general assembly 
which is due to vote on a 
nuclear non-proliferation treaty 
tipping the balance in favour of a 
first-strike policy against russia 
this chain of events will 
then prove unstoppable 
thus precipitating world war iii 
his wife left him 
because his breath stinks 
and he likes to wear her lingerie 
i don't 
so what's this all about then 
that is the bust isn't it 
the one that was broken 
no it's another one different owner 
different part of town 
you were right this is a thing 
something's going on 
what's wrong i thought you'd be pleased 
this is my game face 
and the game is on 
another two have been smashed 
since the welsborough one 
yeah and this one to a 
dr barnicot in holborn 
three in total god knows who'd 
want to do something like this 
yeah but some people have that 
complex don't they an idee fixe 
they obsess over one thing 
and they can't let it go 
no no good 
there were other images of 
margaret margaret 
you know who she is 
the first break-in 
why would a monomaniac 
fixate on just one ooh 
quite a bit of it too 
was there any injury at the crime scene 
nah 
then our suspect must have cut 
themselves breaking the bust 
lambeth 
ah right who 
no he's got a lunch date with 
a brunette forensic officer 
that he doesn't want to be late for 
plus the formaldehyde 
mixed with your cologne 
and your complete inability 
to stop looking at your watch 
trust me though 
she's not right for you 
well thank you mystic meg 
how do you work all that out 
she's got three children in rio 
that he doesn't know about 
are you just making this up 
there's a kid i know 
hacker brilliant hacker 
one of the world's best 
got himself into serious trouble 
with the americans a couple of years ago 
he hacked into the 
pentagon security system 
and i managed to get him off the charge 
therefore he owes me a favour 
so how does that help us 
craig's got a dog 
so i see 
good boy 
hiya 
mary what are you 
no we we agreed we would 
never bring rosie out on a case 
no exactly so don't wait up 
mary what are you doing here 
she's better at this than you 
hang on mary's better than me 
well she is a retired super-agent 
with a terrifying skill-set 
of course she's better 
yeah ok nothing personal 
what so i'm supposed to 
just go home now am i 
what do you think sherlock 
shall we take him with us 
he's handy and loyal 
oh barnicot's house then 
anyone up for a trudge 
keep up he's fast 
he's really not moving 
slow but sure john 
not dissimilar to yourself 
you just like this dog don't you 
well what do you make of it 
they came specifically for 
that thatcher bust why 
clever 
well if you were wounded and you 
knew you were leaving a trail 
or blood in a butcher's 
never mind toby 
better luck next time hmm 
this is it though 
this is the one i can feel it 
not moriarty 
it has to be him it's too 
bizarre it's too baroque 
it's designed to beguile me 
tease me and lure me in 
at last a noose for 
me to put my neck into 
you should have seen the 
state of the front room 
now you think we'd have noticed 
when she was born 
hmm that's the omen 
they're two different things 
she can't be the devil and the antichrist 
yeah can't she 
i'm coming darling mummy's coming 
oh what are you doing 
what are you doing come here 
have you heard of that thing in germany 
you're going to have to be 
more specific craig 
ostalgie people who missed the 
old days under the communists 
according to this there's quite 
a market for cold war memorabilia 
thatcher reagan stalin 
time's a great leveller innit 
thatcher's like i dunno napoleon now 
yes fascinating irrelevant 
where exactly did they come from 
i've got into the records of 
the suppliers gelder and co 
seems they're from georgia 
where exactly 
tbilisi batch of six 
one to welsborough one to hassan 
one to dr barnicot 
two to miss orrie harker 
one to a mr jack sandeford of reading 
lestrade another one 
harker and it's murder this time 
hmm that perks things up a bit 
_ 
_ 
defensive wounds on her face and 
hands throat cut sharp blade 
the same thing inside the house the bust 
that batch of statues was made 
in tbilisi several years ago 
destroying them all makes 
no sense what's the point 
no they're not destroying them 
that's not what's happening 
i've been slow far too slow 
well i'm still being slow over here 
so if you wouldn't mind 
slow but lucky very lucky 
and since they smashed both busts 
our luck might just hold 
jack sandeford of reading 
is where i'm going next 
congratulations by the way 
that's enough now love 
daddy has things to do i'm afraid 
and you need to get to bed come on 
wouldn't it be much simpler 
to take out your grievances 
at the polling station 
you were on the run nowhere 
to hide your precious cargo 
you find yourself in a workshop 
plaster busts of the iron 
lady drying it's clever 
very clever 
but now you've met me and 
you're not so clever are you 
who are you 
my name is sherlock holmes 
goodbye sherlock holmes 
argh 
you're out of time 
i know it's him it must be him 
you think you understand 
you understand nothing 
well before the police 
come in and spoil things 
why don't we just enjoy the moment 
let me present 
interpol's number one case 
too tough for them too boring for me 
the black pearl of the borgias 
it's not possible 
how could she 
everything about who i was is on there 
the problems of your 
past are your business 
the problems of your future 
i don't understand 
she she destroyed it 
she 
you know her you do don't you 
you know the bitch 
she betrayed me 
betrayed us all mary 
this is about mary 
is that what she's 
calling herself now eh 
give it to me 
your hands above your head' 
nobody shoots me 
anyone shoots i kill this man 
i'm leaving this place 
if no-one follows me no-one dies 
you are a policeman i'm a professional 
tell her she's a dead woman 
she's a dead woman walking 
she's my friend 
and she's under my protection 
who are you 
i'm the man who's going 
to kill your friend 
who's sherlock holmes 
not a policeman 
what do you think mate in two 
don't antagonise them darling 
oh what else is there to do 
chess palls after three months 
everything palls 
they'll send someone soon 
they who are they 
seems to me we put an 
awful lot of faith in they 
well i've got something 
they would dearly love 
if only we could get out of here 
i've got ammo 
ammo 
veer left 
what now what do we do 
we die 
well 
he can't have got far 
we'll have him in a bit 
because i think he 
used to work with mary 
ammo ammo ammo 
ammo ammo ammo 
passed out again 
it's no fun when they pass out 
we'll come back later 
what would he do if he knew huh 
about the english woman 
what would you do to a traitor 
maybe we'll tell him one day 
if he lives that long 
i am an idiot i know nothing 
well i've been telling 
you that for ages 
that was quite a text you sent me 
what's going on sherlock 
i was so convinced it was moriarty 
i couldn't see what 
was right under my nose 
expected a pearl 
oh my god that's a 
yes it's an agra 
memory stick like you gave john 
except this one belongs to someone else 
who 
i don't know we we all 
had one but the others were 
haven't you even looked at it yet 
i glanced at it but i prefer 
because i'll know the 
truth when i hear it 
there were four of us agents 
not just agents 
polite term 
alex gabriel 
me and ajay 
there was absolute trust between us 
the memory sticks guaranteed it 
we all had one 
each containing aliases 
our background everything 
we could never be betrayed 
because we had everything we 
needed to destroy the other 
i mean we were at the 
top of our game for years 
and then it all ended 
there was a coup in georgia 
the british embassy in tbilisi 
was taken over lots of hostages 
we got the call to go in get them out 
there was a change of plan 
a last-minute adjustment 
just another voice on the phone 
and a codeword 
like ammunition 
we went in but then 
something went wrong 
something went really wrong 
that was six years ago 
it feels like forever 
i was the only one that made it out 
no 
what 
i met someone tonight 
same someone who's looking 
for the sixth thatcher 
oh my god that's ajay that's him 
what he's alive 
yeah very much so 
i don't believe it this is amazing 
i thought i was the only one 
i thought i was the only one who got out 
where is he i need to see him now 
before you gave it to john 
did you keep your memory stick safe 
yeah of course it was our insurance 
above all they mustn't 
fall into enemy hands 
so ajay survived as well 
and now he's looking for the 
memory stick he managed to hide 
with all of agra's old aliases 
on it but why 
i don't know 
tbilisi was six years ago where's he been 
mary i'm sorry to tell you this 
but he wants you dead 
sorry no no because 
we we were family 
families fall out 
the memory stick is the 
easiest way to track you down 
you're the only other survivor 
it must be you that he wants 
and he's already killed 
looking for the thatcher bust 
well he's just trying to find me 
he survived that's all that matters 
i heard it from his own mouth 
why would he want to kill me 
well it's what he believes 
i suppose i was always 
afraid this might happen 
that something in my past would 
come back to haunt me one day 
yes well he's a very tangible ghost 
god i just wanted a bit of peace 
and i really thought i had it 
no mary 
you do 
i made a vow remember 
to look after the three of you 
sherlock the dragon-slayer 
stay close to me and i will keep 
you safe from him i promise you 
there's something i think you should read 
what is it 
i hoped i wouldn't have to do this 
what are you 
it's all right 
it's for the best believe me 
no 
you just look after them till 
i get back i'm sorry 
i'm so sorry 
agra 
a city on the banks of the river yamuna 
in the northern state of 
uttar pradesh india 
it is 378km west of the state 
capital lucknow 
what are you wikipedia 
oh good i love an acronym 
all the best secret societies have them 
team of agents 
the best but you know all that 
of course i do go on 
one of them ajay is looking for mary 
also one of the team 
indeed well that's news to me 
is it he's already killed 
looking for that memory stick 
agra always worked 
for the highest bidder 
i thought that might include you 
or whatever government 
you're currently propping up 
agra were very reliable 
then came the tbilisi incident 
they were sent in to free the hostages 
but it all went horribly wrong 
and that was that 
we stopped using freelancers 
freelancers are too woolly too messy 
i don't like loose ends not on my watch 
there was something else a detail 
a codeword 
ammo 
it's all i've got 
little enough 
could you do some digging as a favour 
you don't have many favours left 
then i'm calling them all in 
and if you can find who's after 
her and neutralise them what then 
you think you can go 
on saving her forever 
of course 
is that sentiment talking 
no it's me 
difficult to tell the 
difference these days 
told you i made a promise a vow 
all right i'll see what i can do 
but remember this brother mine 
agents like mary tend not 
to reach retirement age 
they get retired in a pretty 
permanent sort of way 
not on my watch 
because you mustn't 
hate me for going away' 
pardon me 
i can hear a squeaking 
only i watched a documentary 
on the discovery channel 
why planes fail 
swore i would never 
fly again yet hear i am 
everything ok madam 
no no no it's not but then 
what's the use in complaining 
i hear a squeaking 
probably the wing will come off is all 
everything's fine i promise you 
just relax 
oh ok relax 
she said relax 
did you have a nice time in london 
it was ok i guess 
but did somebody hide the sun 
did you lose it in the war 
to have an ordinary life 
i'm not running i promise you that 
i just need to do this in my own way' 
oh god i'm i-i don't feel so good 
oh my god 
i don't feel so good 
you're all right 
oh you're sweet 
you have a very kind face 
god will smile on you 
sherlock hanging off my gun arm 
i'm sorry my love' 
i know you'll try to find 
me but there is no point 
every move is random and not even 
sherlock holmes can anticipate 
the roll of a dice 
i need to move the target far 
far away from you 
and rosie and then i'll 
come back my darling 
i swear i will' 
not like this one 
you haven't got a chance not a chance 
i've got you where i want you 
give in give in 
i will destroy you 
you're completely at my mercy 
mr baker well that completes the set 
master bun it's not a set without him 
how many more times mr sherlock 
hmm maybe it's because i'm 
not familiar with the concept 
oh hi mary 
what concept 
happy families nice trip 
hello 
karim would you be so kind 
as to fetch us some tea 
nice to meet you missus 
no i mean how did you find me 
i'm sherlock holmes 
no really though how 
every movement i made was entirely random 
every new personality just 
on the roll of a dice 
mary no human action 
is ever truly random 
an advanced grasp of the 
mathematics of probability 
mapped onto a thorough apprehension 
of human psychology and the 
known dispositions of 
any given individual 
can reduce the number of 
variables considerably 
i myself know of at least 
a seemingly infinite array of 
randomly generated possibilities 
down to the smallest number 
of feasible variables 
but they're really difficult 
so instead i just stuck a tracer 
on the inside of the memory stick 
oh you bastard 
yes i started to run out about then 
in the memory stick 
yeah that was my idea 
uh-huh you said it was your initials 
in a way that was true 
in a way so many lies 
i'm so sorry 
and i don't just mean you 
what 
alex gabriel ajay 
you're r 
rosamund 
rosamund mary 
i always liked mary 
yeah me too 
i used to 
i just i didn't know what else to do 
you could have stayed 
you could have talked to me 
that's what couples are supposed 
to do work things through 
yes 
yes of course 
mary i may not be a very good man 
than you give me credit for 
you're always a good man 
john i've never doubted that 
you never judge you never complain 
i don't deserve you i 
all i ever wanted to do was keep 
you and rosie safe that's all 
i will keep you safe 
but it has to be in london 
it's my city i know the turf 
come home and everything will 
be all right i promise you 
get down 
hello again 
look i thought you were dead 
believe me i did 
i've been looking forward to this 
for longer than you can imagine 
i swear to you i thought you were dead 
i thought i was the only one who got out 
how did you find us 
by following you sherlock holmes 
i mean you're clever 
you found her but i found you 
so perhaps not so clever 
and now here we are at last 
touche 
listen whatever you think you know 
we can talk about this 
we can work it out 
she thought i was dead 
i might as well have been 
it was always just the four of us 
always remember 
oh yeah 
so why do you want to kill me 
do you know how long they kept me 
prisoner what they did to me 
they tortured alex to death 
i can still hear the sound of 
his back breaking but you 
you where were you 
that day at the embassy i escaped 
ha 
but i lost sight of you too so you 
explain where were you 
oh i got out for a while 
long enough to hide my memory stick 
i didn't want that to 
fall into their hands 
i was loyal you see 
loyal to my friends 
but they took me tortured me 
not for information 
not for anything except fun 
they thought i'd give in die 
but i didn't i lived 
and eventually they forgot about 
me rotting in a cell somewhere 
six years they kept me there 
until one day i saw my chance 
oh and i made them pay 
you know all the time i was there 
i just kept picking up things 
little whispers laughter gossip 
how the clever agents had been betrayed 
brought down by you 
me 
you know i'll kill you too 
you know i will ajay 
what you think i care if i die 
i've dreamed of killing you 
of squeezing the life out of 
your treacherous lying throat 
i swear to you ajay 
what did you hear ajay 
when you were a prisoner 
what exactly did you hear 
what did i hear 
ammo 
every day as they tore into me "ammo 
ammo 
ammo ammo" 
we were betrayed 
they said her name 
yeah they said it was the english woman 
no no 
naturally he assumed it was mary' 
couldn't this wait until you're back 
no it's not over 
ajay said that they'd been betrayed 
the hostage-takers knew agra were coming 
there was only a voice on the phone 
how's your latin brother dear 
my latin 
amo amas amat 
i love you love he loves what 
not "ammo" as in ammunition 
but "amo" meaning 
you'd better be right sherlock 
bloody thing 
what's going on 
i'm very sorry lady smallwood 
your security protocols have 
been temporarily rescinded 
what 
it's not really me 
though i think 
i'm more of a "knackered with 
weary old eyes" kind of guy 
well i think they're nice 
nice eyes 
i don't normally do this 
yeah 
_ 
_ 
_ 
now you think we'd have noticed 
when she was born 
hmm noticed what 
the little 666 on her forehead 
hmm that's the omen 
they're two different things 
she can't be the devil and the antichrist 
i'm coming darling i'm coming 
oh what are you doing 
what are you doing 
it's ok 
_ 
_ 
i know 
_ 
ssh oh you're not going to 
stop crying are you 
_ 
i know shall we go and see daddy 
oh let's go and see daddy 
daddy's here it's ok rosie 
i'll take her 
hey baby it's daddy your daddy 
come here rose 
come here darling it's all right 
thank you 
_ 
_ 
this is absolutely 
ridiculous and you know it 
how many more times 
six years ago you held the brief for 
foreign operations code name love 
and you're basing all 
this on a code name 
on a whispered voice on the telephone 
come on mycroft 
you were the conduit for agra 
every assignment 
every detail they got from you 
it was my job 
then there was the tbilisi incident 
agra went in 
not by me 
mycroft we have known 
each other a long time 
i promise you 
i haven't the foggiest idea 
what all this is about 
you wound up agra and all 
the other freelancers 
i haven't done any of the 
things you're accusing me of 
not one 
not one 
do you think she'll like bedtime stories 
i'd like to do those 
yeah 
yeah i just make a series of 
gurgling noises at the moment 
although she does seem to enjoy them 
well i'll have to give that a go 
got a lot to catch up on 
you understand nothing' 
langdale porlock and love' 
what a receptionist picks up 
well being being so perfect 
mary i i need to tell you 
hang on 
can you tell me later 
well no we can't just go 
i'll come as soon as i've found 
someone mrs hudson 
well we should both stay and wait for her 
you know that's not going to happen 
if there's more to this case 
you need to see it 
yeah ok you win 
will be closing in five minutes 
the exit thank you' 
your office said i'd find you here 
this was always my favourite 
spot for agents to meet 
we're like them 
ghostly living in the shadows 
predatory 
well it depends which side you're on 
also we have to keep moving or we die 
nice location for the final act 
couldn't have chosen it better myself 
but then i never could resist 
a touch of the dramatic 
i just come here to look at the fish 
i knew this would happen one day 
would you mind cutting to the chase 
you're very sure of yourself aren't you 
with good reason 
in a famous market in baghdad" 
i really have never liked this story 
i'm just like the merchant in the story 
i thought i could out-run the inevitable 
i've always been looking over my shoulder 
always expecting to see 
the grim figure of 
death 
let me introduce ammo 
you were ammo 
you were the person 
on the phone that time 
using agra as her private 
assassination unit 
why did you betray us 
why does anyone do anything 
well it would be churlish to refuse 
worked very well for a few years 
i bought a nice cottage in 
cornwall on the back of it 
but 
the ambassador in tbilisi found out 
i thought i'd had it 
then she was taken hostage in that coup 
i couldn't believe my luck 
that bought me a little time 
but then you found out 
your boss had sent agra in 
very handy they were 
always such reliable killers 
what you didn't know mary 
was that this one also tipped 
off the hostage-takers 
lady smallwood gave the order 
but i sent another one to the terrorists 
with a nice little clue 
about her code name 
should anyone have an enquiring mind 
seemed to do the trick 
and you thought your troubles were over 
i was tired 
tired of the mess of it all 
i just wanted some peace some clarity 
the hostages were killed 
agra too 
or so i thought 
my secret was safe 
but apparently not 
just a little peace 
that's all you wanted too wasn't it 
a family home 
really i understand 
so just let me get out of here right 
let me just walk away 
i'll vanish i'll go forever 
what do you say 
after what you did 
mary no 
ok 
london aquarium yes now 
i was never a field agent 
i always thought i'd be rather good 
well you handled the 
operation in tbilisi very well 
thanks 
it can't have been easy all those 
years sitting in the back 
keeping your mouth shut when 
you knew you were cleverer than 
most of the people in the room 
same old drudge day in day out 
never getting out there 
where all the excitement was 
just back to your little 
flat on wigmore street 
they've taken up the pavement 
outside the post office there 
the local clay on your 
shoes is very distinctive 
yes your little flat 
it would have to be modest 
and you spent all the money on 
that cottage didn't you 
and what are you widowed or divorced 
wedding ring is at least 30 
years old and you've moved it 
to another finger that means 
you're sentimentally attached to it 
but you're not still married 
i favour widowed given the number 
of cats you share your life with 
judging by the cat 
hairs on your cardigan 
a divorcee is more likely 
to look for a new partner 
a widow to fill the void 
left by her dead husband 
there's clearly no-one new in your life 
or you wouldn't be spending your 
friday nights in an aquarium 
that accounts for the drink problem too 
the slight tremor in your hand 
the red wine stain ghosting your top lip 
so yes i'd say jealousy 
was your motive after all 
to prove how good you are 
to make up for the inadequacies 
of your little life 
well mrs norbury 
i must admit this is unexpected 
vivian norbury 
who out-smarted them all 
all except sherlock holmes 
there's no way out 
so it would seem 
you've seen right through me mr holmes 
it's what i do 
maybe i can still surprise you 
now come on be sensible 
hmm no i don't think so 
ah surprise 
everything's fine it's going to be ok 
get an ambulance 
it's all right it's all right 
all right mary mary 
stay with me stay with me 
come on doctor 
you can do better than that 
come on mary mary 
oh god john i think this is it 
no no no no it's not 
you gave me everything i could ever

ordinary life but who knows

long time at the office boring

having an affair yes

i know human ash leave 
we are prepared to offer any 
sum of money you care to mention 
for the recovery 
of these files boring 
we have this website it explains 
the true meaning of comic books 
cos people miss a lot of the themes 
but then all the comic books 
started coming true 
oh interesting 
geek interpreter what's that 
that's the title 
what does it need a title for 
do people actually read your blog 
where do you think our clients 
come from i have a website 
in which you enumerate 240 
different types of tobacco ash 
nobody's reading your website 
right then dyed blonde hair 
no obvious cause of death 
except for these speckles 
whatever they are 
oh for god's sakes 
what the speckled blonde 
they wouldn't let us see 
granddad when he was dead 
is that cos he'd gone to heaven 
people don't really go to heaven 
when they die 
they're taken to a 
special room and burned 
sherlock 
there was a plane 
crash in dusseldorf yesterday 
everyone dead 
suspected terrorist bomb 
we do watch the news 
you said "boring" and turned over 
well according to the flight details 
this man was checked in on board 
inside his coat he's got a stub from his 
boarding pass napkins from the flight 
even one of those special biscuits 
here's his passport 
stamped at berlin airport 
so this man should have died in a 
plane crash in germany yesterday 
but instead he's in a car boot 
in southwark 
lucky escape 
any ideas 
eight so far 
ok four ideas 
maybe two ideas 
no no no 
don't mention the unsolved ones 
people want to know you're human 
why 
because they're interested

why are they hmm look at that 
i reset that counter last night

had nearly 2000 hits in 
the last eight hours 
this is your living sherlock not 
so what's this one 
belly button murders 
the navel treatment 
urgh 
there's a lot of press outside guys 
well they won't be interested in us 
yeah that was before you were 
an internet phenomenon 
a couple of them specifically wanted 
photographs of you two 
god's sake 
john hmm 
cover your face and walk fast 
still it's good for the public 
image 
big case like this 
i'm a private detective the last 
thing i need is a public image 
hello 
i think it's time don't you 
oh 
ugh 
she sighs 
oh 
oh dear 
thumbs 
the door was 
the door was 
boys you've got another one 
ooh 
tell us from the start 
don't be boring 
engine splutters and dies 
engine backfires 
he sighs 
hey 
are you ok 
excuse me 
are you all right 
sir phone call for you 
carter 
who 
well you're about 
to meet him now 
this is your case it's entirely 
up to you this is just 
five minutes on your crime scene 
to say and as far as possible ' 
try not to punch him 
ok 
sir this gentleman says he needs 
to speak to you yes i know 
sherlock holmes 
john watson are you set up 
for wi-fi 
a tiny bit humiliating' 
it's ok i'm fine 
now 
show me to the stream 
look this is a six 
there's no point in my 
leaving the flat for 
anything less than a 
seven we agreed 
now go back 
show me the grass 
when did we agree that 
we agreed it yesterday stop 
yesterday i was in dublin 
it's hardly my fault 
you weren't listening 
doorbell rings 
shut up 'do you just carry 
on talking when i'm away 
often are you away 
watson sighs 
it's there 
yes' 
yeah 
if you're thinking gunshot 
to the back from a blunt instrument 
along with the killer' 
it's got to be an eight at least 
you've got two more minutes 
they want to know more 
about the driver 
oh forget him he's an idiot 
why else would he think himself a 
suspect i think he's a suspect 
a mute button and i will use it 
up a bit 
i'm not talking from down here 
ok just take it take it 
a crime without a single witness ' 
why would he call the police 
and consult a detective 
fair play he's trying to be clever 
it's overconfidence sherlock sighs 
did you see him 
morbidly obese the undisguised 
halitosis of a single 
man living on his own 
the right sleeve of an 
internet porn addict the 
breathing pattern of an 
untreated heart condition 
low self-esteem tiny iq and 
a limited life expectancy 
and you think he's a 
criminal mastermind 
don't worry this is just stupid 
what did you say heart what 
go to the stream 
what's in the stream 
go and see mrs hudson: sherlock 
you weren't answering your doorbell 
his room's through the back 
get him some clothes 
who the hell are you 
sorry mr holmes

dr watson yeah it's for you 
ok thanks no sir the helicopter

they laugh 
at buckingham palace right 
he coughs 
ha ha aah aah i am seriously 
fighting an impulse to steal an ashtray 
sherlock sniggers 
he clears his throat 
what are we doing here sherlock 
seriously what i don't know 
here to see the queen 
oh apparently yes 
they laugh 
just once 
can you two behave like grown-ups 
we solve crimes i blog about 
it and he forgets his pants 
i wouldn't hold out 
too much hope 
i was in the middle of a case mycroft 
what the hiker and the backfire 
i glanced at the police report 
a bit obvious surely 
transparent 
time to move on then 
he clears his throat 
he sighs 
we are in buckingham palace the 
very heart of the british nation 
sherlock holmes 
put your trousers on what for 
your client 
and my client is 
illustrious in the extreme 
and remaining i have to inform you 
entirely anonymous 
mycroft harry 
may i just apologise for the 
state of my little brother 
a full-time occupation 
i imagine 
and this must be dr john 
watson formerly of the 
fifth northumberland fusiliers 
hello yes 
my employer is a tremendous 
fan of your blog your employer 
particularly enjoyed the one about the 
aluminium crutch thank you ahem 
and mr holmes the younger 
you look taller in 
your photographs 
i take the precaution of a 
good coat and a short friend 
mycroft i don't do 
anonymous clients 
i'm used to mystery at 
one end of my cases 
both ends is too much work 
good morning 
this is a matter of national 
importance grow up 
get off my sheet or what 
or i'll just walk away 
i'll let you 
boys please not here 
who is my client 
take a look at where you're 
standing and make a deduction 
you are to be engaged by the highest 
in the land now for god's sake 
put your clothes on 
sherlock sighs 
i'll be mother 
and there is a whole 
childhood in a nutshell 
my employer has a problem 
a matter has come to 
light of an extremely 
delicate and potentially 
criminal nature 
and in this hour of need dear 
brother your name has arisen why 
we have a police force of sorts 
even a marginally secret service 
why come to me 
people come to you for help don't 
they mr holmes 
not to date anyone with a navy 
this is a matter of the highest 
security and therefore of trust 
you don't trust your own 
secret service naturally not 
they all spy on people for money 
i do think we have a timetable 
yes of course erm 
what do you know about this woman 
nothing whatsoever 
then you should be paying more 
attention 
message tone 
she's been at the centre of two 
political scandals in the last year 
and recently ended the marriage 
of a prominent novelist 
by having an affair 
with both participants separately 
you know i don't concern myself 
with trivia 
who is she 
irene adler 
professionally known as "the woman" 
professionally 
there are many names for what 
she does she prefers "dominatrix" 
dominatrix don't be alarmed 
it's to do with sex 
sex doesn't alarm me 
how would you know 
she provides shall we say 
recreational scolding 
for those who enjoy 
that sort of thing 
and are prepared to pay for it 
these are all from her website 
and i assume this adler woman has 
some compromising photographs 
you're very quick mr holmes 
hardly a difficult deduction 
photographs of whom 
a person of significance 
to my employer 
we'd prefer not to say 
any more at this time 
you can't tell us anything 
i can tell you it's a young person 
a young female person 
how many photographs 
a considerable number apparently 
do miss adler and this 
young female person 
appear in these photographs 
together yes 
i assume in a number of 
compromising scenarios 
an imaginative range 
we are assured 
john you might want to put that cup 
back in your saucer now 
can you help us mr holmes how 
will you take the case 
what case 
pay her now and in full 
as miss adler remarks in her 
masthead know when you are beaten 
she doesn't want anything 
she got in touch 
she informed us that the 
photographs existed 
she indicated that she had no 
intention to use them 
to extort either money or favour 
oh a power play 
a power play with the most powerful 
family in britain 
now that is a dominatrix ooh this 
is getting rather fun isn't it 
sherlock hmm where is she 
in london currently 
she's staying 
text me the details i'll be in 
touch by the end of the day 
do you really think 
you'll have news by then 
no i think i'll have 
the photographs 
one can only hope 
you're as good as you seem to think 
i'll need some 
equipment of course 
anything you require 
i'll have it sent 
can i have a box of matches 
i'm sorry 
or your cigarette lighter 
either will do 
i don't smoke no i know you don't 
but your employer does 
we have kept a lot of people 
successfully in the dark 
about this little fact mr holmes 
i'm not the commonwealth 
and that's as modest as he gets 
pleasure to meet you 
laters 
ok the smoking how did you know 
the evidence was right under 
your nose john 
as ever you see but do not observe 
observe what the ashtray 
watson laughs 
sherlock chuckles 
sound of flashbulbs 
kate 
we're going to have a visitor 
i'll need a bit of time 
to get ready 
a long time 
hmm ages 
what are you doing 
i'm going to into battle john 
i need the right armour 
no 
nah 
works for me 
everything works on you 
so what's the plan 
we know her address 
we just ring her doorbell 
exactly just here please 
you didn't even 
change your clothes 
then it's time to add 
a splash of colour 
are we here 
two streets away but this will do 
for what punch me in the face 
shade 
blood 
punch you yes punch me 
in the face didn't you hear me 
i always hear "punch me" when you 
speak but it's usually sub-text 
oh for god's sakes 
thank you that was 
ok i think we're done now john 
you want to remember sherlock 
i was a soldier i killed people 
you were a doctor 
i had bad days 
what are you going to wear 
my battle dress oh lucky boy 
buzzer 
bell rings 
hello 
oh very sorry to disturb you um 
i've just been attacked um 
um and i think they 
they took my wallet 
and um and my phone 
um please could you help me 
i can phone the police if you want 
thank you could you please 
would you mind 
if i just waited here 
just until they come 
thank you thank you so much 
buzzer 
thank you oh 
i saw it all happen 
it's ok i'm a doctor 
have you got a first aid kit 
in the kitchen please 
thank you thank you 
hello 
sorry to hear you've been hurt 
i don't think kate caught your name 
i'm so sorry i'm 
it's always hard to remember an alias 
when you've had a fright isn't it 
well there now 
we're both defrocked 
mr sherlock holmes 
miss adler i presume 
look at those cheekbones 
i could cut myself 
slapping that face 
would you like me to try 
right this should do it 
i've missed something haven't i 
please sit down or if you'd like 
some tea i can call the maid 
i had some at the palace 
i know clearly 
i had a tea too at the palace 
if anyone's interested 
do you know the big problem 
with a disguise mr holmes 
however hard you try 
it's always a self-portrait 
you think i'm a vicar 
with a bleeding face 
no i think you're damaged 
delusional 
and believe in a higher power 
in your case it's yourself 
hmm and somebody loves you 
if i had to punch that face 
i'd avoid your nose and teeth too 
ha-ha 
could you put something on please 
er anything at all a napkin 
why are you feeling exposed 
i don't think john knows 
where to look 
no i think he knows exactly where 
i'm not sure about you 
if i was to look at naked women 
i'd borrow john's laptop 
you do borrow my laptop 
i confiscate it 
never mind we've got better 
things to talk about 
now tell me i need to know 
how was it done 
what 
the hiker with the bashed-in head 
how was he killed 
that's not why i'm here 
you're here for the photographs 
but that's never going to happen 
and as we're chatting 
that story's not out 
how do you know about it 
i know one of the policemen 
well i know what he likes oh 
and you like policemen 
i like detective stories 
and detectives 
brainy is the new sexy 
the position of the car 
relative to the hiker 
that and the fact that the 
death blow was to the 
back of the head that's 
all you need to know 
ok tell me 
how was he murdered he wasn't 
you don't think it was murder 
i know it wasn't how the same way 
i know the victim was a sportsman 
recently returned from foreign travel 
and that the photographs i'm looking 
for are in this room ok but how 
so they are in this room thank you 
john man the door let no-one in 
two men alone in the countryside 
several yards apart and one car 
oh i i thought you were looking 
for the photos now no no 
looking takes ages 
i'm just going to find them 
but you're clever and we've 
got a moment so let's 
pass the time 
two men a car nobody else 
driver's trying to fix his engine 
getting nowhere 
and the hiker is taking a moment 
looking at the sky 
watching the birds any moment now 
something is going to happen what 
the hiker is going to die 
no that's the result 
what's going to happen 
i don't understand 
oh well try to 
why because you cater 
to the whims of the pathetic 
and take your clothes off 
to make an impression 
stop boring me and think 
it's the new sexy 
the car's going to backfire there's 
going to be a loud noise so what 
noises are important they can 
tell you everything for instance 
beeping 
thank you 
on hearing a smoke alarm a mother 
would look towards her child 
amazing how fire 
exposes our priorities 
i really hope you don't have 
a baby in here 
all right john 
you can turn it off now 
i said you can turn it off now 
give me a minute 
thank you 
hmm 
you should always use gloves 
with these things you know 
heaviest oil deposit is always 
on the first key used 
that's a 3 but after 
that the sequence is 
impossible to read 
i see it's a six digit code 
it can't be your birthday 
no disrespect but you 
were born in the '80s and 
i'd tell you the code right now 
but you know what i already have 
think 
hands behind your head 
on the floor keep it still 
sorry sherlock 
miss adler on the floor 
don't you want me on the floor too 
no sir i want you to open the safe 
american interesting 
why would you care 
sir the safe now please 
i don't know the code 
we've been listening 
she said she told you 
if you've been listening 
you'll know she didn't 
i assume i missed something 
from your reputation 
i assume you didn't mr holmes 
she's the one 
who knows the code ask her 
yes sir she also knows 
the code that calls 
the police and sets off 
the burglar alarm 
i've learned not to trust her 
mr holmes doesn't shut up 
one more word out of you 
just one and i will decorate that 
wall with the insides of your head 
that for me 
will not be a hardship 
mr archer at the count of three 
shoot dr watson what 
i don't know the code one 
i don't know the code two 
she didn't tell me i don't know it 
i'm prepared to believe you 
any second now 
three no stop 
beeping 
beeping 
safe unlocks 
thank you mr holmes 
open it please 
vatican cameos 
do you mind not at all 
he's dead thank you 
you were very observant observant 
i'm flattered don't be flattered 
there'll be more of them they'll be 
keeping an eye on the building 
we should call the police yes 
on their way for god's sake 
oh shut up it's quick 
check the rest of the house 
see how they got in 
well that's the knighthood 
in the bag oh and that's mine 
all the photographs are 
on here i presume 
i have copies of course 
no you don't 
you'll have permanently disabled 
any kind of uplink or connection 
unless the contents of this phone 
are unique you couldn't sell them 
who said i'm selling 
well why would they be interested 
whatever's on the phone it's 
clearly not just photographs 
that camera-phone is 
my life mr holmes 
i'd die before i let you take it 
it's my protection 
sherlock it was 
must have come in this way clearly 
it's all right she's just out cold 
oh god knows she's 
used to that 
there's a back door 
better check it dr watson 
sure 
you're very calm 
well your booby trap did just 
kill a man he would have killed me 
it was self defence in advance 
what is that what 
give it to me 
now give it to me 
no 
give it to me argh no 
oh for goodness sake 
drop it 
i said drop it 
ah thank you dear 
now tell that sweet little posh 
thing the pictures are safe with me 
they're not for blackmail 
just for insurance 
besides 
i might want to see her again 
oh no no no no no 
it's been a pleasure 
don't spoil it 
this is how i want you 
to remember me 
the woman who beat you 
goodnight mr sherlock holmes 
jesus what are you doing 
he'll sleep for a few hours 
make sure he doesn't choke 
on his own vomit it 
makes for a very unattractive corpse 
what's this 
what have you given him 
sherlock he'll be fine 
i've used it on loads of my friends 
sherlock can you hear me 
you know i was wrong about him 
he did know where to look 
for what 
what are you talking about 
the key-code to my safe 
what was it 
shall i tell him 
my measurements 
siren wails 
sirens wail 
got it 
oh ssh ssh no don't get up 
i'll do the talking 
so the car's about to backfire and 
the hiker he's staring at the sky 
you said he could be watching 
birds but he wasn't was he 
he was watching 
another kind of flying thing 
the car backfires 
and the hiker turns to look 
which was his big mistake 
by the time the driver looks 
up the hiker is already dead 
he doesn't see what killed him 
because it's already being 
washed downstream 
an accomplished sportsman recently 
returned from foreign travel with 
a boomerang 
you got that from one look 
definitely the new sexy 
i 
i 
hush now 
it's ok 
i'm only returning your coat 
john 
john

erotic moan text alert 
the photographs are perfectly safe 
in the hands of a fugitive sex worker 
she's not interested in blackmail 
she wants protection 
for some reason 
i take it you've stood 
down the police 
investigation into the 
shooting at her house 
how can we do anything while she has 
the photographs our hands are tied 
she'd applaud your choice of words 
you see how this works the camera-phone 
is her get out of jail free card 
you have to leave her alone 
treat her like royalty mycroft 
though not the way she treats 
royalty 
erotic moan text alert 
what was that 
text 
but what was that noise 
did you know there were 
other people after her too 
before you sent john and i in there 
cia trained killers i think 
thanks for that 
it's a disgrace sending your little 
brother into danger like that 
family is all we have in the end 
mycroft holmes 
oh shut up mrs hudson 
mycroft 
apologies thank you 
though do in fact shut up 
erotic moan text alert 
oh it's a bit rude 
that noise isn't it 
there's nothing you can do and nothing 
she will do as far as i can see 
i can put maximum 
surveillance on her 
why bother 
you can follow her on twitter 
i believe her user name is 
the whip hand 
most amusing excuse me hello 
why does your phone make that noise 
what noise 
that noise the one it just made 
it's a text alert 
means i've got a text 
hmm your texts don't usually 
make that noise 
well somebody got hold of the phone 
and apparently as a joke 
personalised their text alert noise 
hmm so every time they text you 
erotic moan text alert 
it would seem so 
could you turn that phone down a 
bit at my time of life it's 
ahem

got hold of your phone

i'll leave you to your deductions

for a couple of 
compromising photographs

any concern of yours

to make to a very old friend

the antlers

imagination mrs hudson mrs h

everybody saying hello to each 
other how wonderful

no stopping them apparently 
it's the one day of the year where 
the boys have to be nice to me 
so it's almost worth it 
john hmm the counter on 
your blog still says 1895 
oh no christmas 
is cancelled() 
and you've got a photograph of me 
wearing that hat people like it 
no they don't what people 
how's the hip 
oh it's atrocious 
but thanks for asking 
i've seen much worse 
but then i do post-mortems 
oh god sorry

i wasn't expecting to see you 
i thought you were in dorset 
for christmas

to your sister's yeah 
sherlock was complaining saying 
first time ever she's cleaned up 
her act off the booze 
nope shut up sherlock 
i see you've got a new boyfriend molly 
you're serious about him sorry what 
you're seeing him tonight giving 
him a gift take a day off 
shut up have a drink 
surely you see the 
perfectly wrapped 
present in the bag 
the others are slapdash 
it's for someone special 
the shade of red echoes her lipstick 
or one she's deliberately 
trying to encourage 
either way miss hooper 
has love on her mind 
that she's serious about him is clear 
from the fact she's giving him a gift 
it suggests long-term hopes 
that she's seeing him tonight is 
evident from her make-up and clothes 
obviously trying to compensate for 
the size of her mouth and breasts 
you always say such horrible things 
every time always 
always 
i am sorry forgive me 
merry christmas molly hooper 
erotic moan text alert

christmas phone calls now are we

the description 
had her brought here 
your home from home 
you didn't need to come in molly

so it might be a bit difficult 
that's her isn't it

that's her 
thank you miss hooper 
who is she how did sherlock 
recognise her from not her face 
just the one why 
merry christmas

of those one of those law things 
we're in a morgue 
there's only 
so much damage you can do 
how did you know she was dead 
she had an item in her possession 
one she said her life depended on 
she chose to give it up 
where is this item now 
look at them 
they all care so much 
do you ever wonder 
if there's something wrong with us 
all lives end 
all hearts are broken 
caring is not an advantage 
sherlock

mycroft could just phone me 
if he didn't have this 
bloody stupid power complex 
couldn't we just go to a cafe 
sherlock doesn't 
follow me everywhere 
through there 
he's on his way 
you were right 
he thinks it's mycroft 
he's writing sad music 
doesn't eat barely talks 
only to correct the television 
i'd say he was heart-broken 
but er well he's sherlock 
he does all that anyway 
hello dr watson 
tell him you're alive 
he'd come after me 
i'll come after you if you don't 
hmm i believe you 
you were dead on a slab 
it was definitely you 
dna tests are only as good 
as the records you keep 
and i bet you know the record keeper 
i know what he likes 
and i needed to disappear 
then how come i can see you 
and i don't even want to 
look i made a mistake 
i sent something to sherlock for 
safekeeping now i need it back

it's for his own safety 
so is this 
tell him you're alive 
i can't fine i'll tell him

no sherlock always replies 
to everything

something that we want mr holmes

got himself rather badly injured 
oh a few broken ribs fractured 
skull suspected punctured lung 
he fell out of a window 
oh it stings 
oh that was right on my bins 
groaning outside 
and exactly how many times 
did he fall out the window 
it's all a bit of a blur 
detective inspector 
i lost count 
she'll have to sleep 
upstairs in our flat tonight 
we need to look after her 
no she's fine 
no she's not look at her 
she's got to take some time 
away from baker street 
she can stay with her sister 
doctor's orders 
don't be absurd 
she's in shock for god's sake 
and all over some stupid 
camera-phone where is it anyway 
safest place i know 
you left it in the pocket of your 
second best dressing gown you clot 
i managed to sneak it out when 
they thought i was having a cry 
thank you 
shame on you john watson 
shame on me 
mrs hudson leave baker street 
england would fall 
where is it now 
where no-one will look 
whatever's on that phone 
is more than just pictures 
yes it is 
so she's alive then 
how are we feeling about that 
big ben chimes 
happy new year john 
do you think you'll be 
seeing her again 
he plays 'auld lang syne' 
text alert 
is that a phone 
it's a camera-phone 
and you're x-raying it 
yes i am 
whose phone is it a woman's 
your girlfriend 
she's my girlfriend because 
i'm x-raying her possessions 
well we all do silly things yes 
they do don't they 
very silly 
she sent this to my address 
she loves to play games she does 
hey sherlock 
we have a client 
what in your bedroom 
oh 
so who's after you 
people who want to kill me 
who's that 
killers 
it would help if you were 
a tiny bit more specific 
so you faked your own death 
to get ahead of them 
it worked for a while 
except you let john know 
you're alive therefore me 
i knew you'd keep my secret 
you couldn't 
but you did didn't you 
where's my camera-phone 
it's not here 
we're not stupid 
what have you done with it 
if they've guessed 
they'll be watching you 
then they'll know i took 
a safety deposit box 
at a bank on the strand 
a few months ago 
i need it 
well we can't just go 
and get it can we 
molly hooper she could collect it 
take it to barts 
then one of your homeless network could 
bring it here leave it in the cafe 
one of the boys downstairs 
could bring it up the back 
very good john excellent plan 
full of intelligent precautions 
thank you 
so why don't i phone 
so what do you keep on here 
in general i mean 
pictures information 
anything i might find useful 
for blackmail for protection 
i make my way in the world 
i misbehave 
i like to know people will be on my 
side exactly when i need them to be 
so how do you acquire this information 
i told you i misbehave 
but you've acquired something 
more danger than protection 
do you know what it is yes 
but i don't understand it 
i assumed show me 
the passcode 
it's not working 
no because it's 
a duplicate i had made 
into which you just 
entered the numbers 1058 
i assumed you'd choose something more 
specific than that but thanks anyway 
i told you that 
camera-phone was my life 
i know when it's in my hand 
oh you're rather good 
you're not so bad 
hamish 
john hamish watson just 
if you were looking for baby names 
there was a man an mod official 
and i knew what he liked 
one of the things 
he liked was showing off 
he told me this email was going 
to save the world 
he didn't know but i photographed it 
it's a bit small on that screen 
can you read it 
yes code obviously 
i had one of the country's 
best cryptographers take a look 
though he was mostly upside down 
as i recall 
couldn't figure it out 
what can you do mr holmes 
go on impress a girl 
there's a margin for error 
but i'm pretty sure 
there's a 747 leaving 
heathrow tomorrow at 
apparently it's going to 
save the world i'm not sure how 
but give me a moment i've only 
been on the case eight seconds 
oh come on it's not code 
these are seats on a jet 
look no 'i' because 
it can be mistaken for one 
no letters past 'k' 
the width of the plane is the limit 
the numbers always appear 
not in sequence 
but the letters have 
little runs of sequence 
families and couples 
sitting together 
only a jumbo's wide enough 
for a letter 'k' or 
rows past 55 so there's 
always an upstairs 
a row 13 eliminates 
superstitious airlines 
the style of the flight number 
assuming a british point of origin 
because of the original source 
and assuming the crisis is imminent 
the only flight that matches 
all the criteria and 
departs within the week is 
the 630 to baltimore 
tomorrow from heathrow 
please don't feel obliged to tell me 
that was amazing 
john's expressed that in every 
possible variant available in english 
i would have you right here 
on this desk 
until you begged for mercy twice 
john can you check those 
flight schedules see if i'm right 
i'm on it yeah 
i've never begged for mercy 
in my life 
twice 
yeah you're right 
flight double 'o' seven 
what did you say you're right 
no what did you say after that 
double 'o' seven 
flight double 'o' seven 
double 'o' seven 
double 'o' seven 
something double 'o' seven 
what 
double 'o' seven 
double 'o' seven what 
what something what 
bond air is go 
bond air is go 
bond air is go 
blows raspberry 
coventry i've never been 
is it nice 
where's john 
he went out a couple of hours ago 
i was just talking to him 
he said you do that 
what's coventry got to do 
with anything 
it's a story probably not true 
in the second world 
war the allies knew 
coventry was going to 
get bombed because 
they'd broken the german code but 
didn't want the germans to know that 
so they let it happen anyway 
have you ever had anyone 
i'm sorry 
and when i say had 
i'm being indelicate 
i don't understand 
i'll be delicate then 
let's have dinner why 
you might be hungry 
i'm not good 
why would i want to have dinner 
if i wasn't hungry 
mr holmes 
if it was the end of the world 
if this was the very last night 
would you have dinner with me 
sherlock 
too late 
that's not the end of the world 
that's mrs hudson 
sherlock this man was at the door 
is the bell still not working 
he shot it 
have you come to take me away again 
yes mr holmes well i decline 
i don't think you do 
there's going to be a bomb 
on a passenger jet 
the british and americans 
know about it 
but rather than expose 
their source they're going 
to let it happen 
the plane will blow up 
coventry all over again 
the wheel turns 
nothing is ever new 
well you're looking all better 
how you feeling 
like putting a bullet in your brain 
sir 
hmm 
they'd pin a medal on me if i did 
sir 
the coventry conundrum 
what do you think of my solution 
the flight of the dead 
plane blows up midair mission 
accomplished for the terrorists 
hundreds of casualties 
but nobody dies 
neat don't you think 
you've been stumbling around 
the fringes of this one for ages 
or were you too bored 
to notice the pattern 
they wouldn't let us see granddad 
when he was dead 
she's not my real aunt 
i know human ash 
we ran a similar project with 
the germans a while back 
though i believe one of our 
passengers didn't make the flight 
but that's the deceased for you 
late in every sense of the word 
how is the plane going to fly 
oh of course unmanned aircraft 
hardly new 
it doesn't fly 
it will never fly 
this entire project is cancelled 
the terrorist cells have been 
informed we know about the bomb 
we can't fool them now 
we've lost everything 
one fragment of one email 
and months and years of planning 
finished 
your mod man 
that's all it takes 
one lonely naive man 
desperate to show off 
and a woman clever enough 
to make him feel special 
you should screen your 
defence people more carefully 
i'm not talking about the mod man 
sherlock i'm talking about you 
the damsel in distress 
in the end 
are you really so obvious 
because this was textbook 
the promise of love the pain 
of loss the joy of redemption 
then give him a puzzle 
and watch him dance 
don't be absurd 
absurd 
how quickly did you decipher 
that email for her 
was it the full minute 
or were you really eager to impress 
i think it was less than 
five seconds 
i drove you into her path 
i'm sorry i didn't know 
mr holmes i think we need to talk 
so do i there are a number of 
aspects i'm still not clear on 
not you junior you're done now 
there's more loads more 
on this phone i've got secrets 
pictures 
and scandals that could 
topple your whole world 
you have no idea how much havoc i can 
cause and exactly one way to stop me 
unless you want to tell 
your masters 
that your biggest security leak 
is your own little brother 
we have people 
who can get into this 
i tested that theory for you 
i let sherlock holmes 
try it for six months 
sherlock dear tell him what you 
found when you x-rayed my phone 
four additional units 
wired inside the casing 
i suspect containing acid 
or a small explosive 
any attempt to open it 
will burn the hard drive 
explosive 
it's more me 
some data is always recoverable 
take that risk 
you have a passcode to open this 
i deeply regret to say we have 
people who can extract it from you 
sherlock there will be 
two passcodes 
one to open the phone 
one to burn the drive 
even under duress you can't know 
which one she's given 
and there would be no second 
attempt he's good isn't he 
i should have him on a leash 
in fact i might 
we destroy this then 
no-one has the information 
fine good idea 
unless there are lives 
of british citizens 
depending on the information 
you burn 
are there 
telling you would be playing fair 
i'm not playing any more 
a list of my requests 
and some ideas about my protection 
once they're granted 
i'd say it wouldn't blow 
much of a hole in the 
wealth of a nation but 
then i'd be lying 
i imagine you'd like to sleep on it 
thank you yes 
too bad 
off you pop and talk to people 
you've been very thorough 
i wish our lot were 
half as good as you 
i can't take all the credit 
i had a bit of help 
jim moriarty sends his love 
yes he's been in touch 
seems desperate for my attention 
which i'm sure can be arranged 
i had all this stuff and 
never knew what to do with it 
thank god for 
the consultant criminal 
gave me a lot of advice about how 
to play the holmes boys 
do you know what he calls you 
the ice man 
and the virgin 
didn't even ask for anything 
he just likes to cause trouble 
that's my kind of man 
and here you are 
the dominatrix who brought 
a nation to its knees 
nicely played 
no 
sorry 
i said no 
very very close but no 
you got carried away 
the game was too elaborate 
you were enjoying yourself too much 
there's no such thing as too much 
oh enjoying the thrill 
of the chase is fine 
craving the distraction of the game 
i sympathise but sentiment 
sentiment is a chemical defect 
found in the losing side 
sentiment 
what are you talking about 
you 
oh dear god 
look at the poor man 
you don't actually think 
i was interested in you 
why 
because you're the great 
sherlock holmes 
the clever detective 
in the funny hat 
no 
because i took your pulse 
elevated 
your pupils dilated 
i imagine john watson thinks 
love's a mystery to me 
but the chemistry is incredibly 
simple and very destructive 
when we first met you 
told me that disguise 
is always a self-portrait 
the combination to your safe 
your measurements 
but this 
this is far more intimate 
this is your heart and you should 
never let it rule your head 
you could have chosen any number 
and walked out with everything 
but you just couldn't resist it 
could you 
i've always assumed that love 
is a dangerous disadvantage 
thank you for the final proof 
everything i said it's not real 
i was just playing the game 
i know 
and this is just losing 
there you are brother 
hope the contents make up for any 
inconvenience caused tonight 
i'm certain they will 
if you're feeling kind lock her up 
let her go and i doubt 
she'll survive long 
are you expecting me to beg 
yes 
please 
you're right 
i won't even last six months 
sorry about dinner 
you don't smoke 
i also don't frequent cafes 
this the file on irene adler 
closed forever 
i am about to go 
and inform my brother 
or if you prefer you are 
that she somehow got herself into a 
witness protection scheme in america 
new name new identity 
she will survive and thrive 
but he will never see her again 
why would he care 
he despised her at the end 
won't even mention her by name 
just 'the woman' 
is that loathing or a salute 
one of a kind 
the one woman who matters 
he's not like that 
he doesn't feel things that way 
i don't think 
my brother has the brain 
of a scientist or a philosopher 
yet he elects to be a detective 
what might we deduce 
about his heart 
i don't know 
neither do i 
but initially 
he wanted to be a pirate 
he'll be ok with this 
witness protection never 
seeing her again 
he'll be fine 
i agree 
that's why i decided 
to tell him that 
instead of what 
she's dead 
she was captured by a terrorist 
cell in karachi two months ago 
and beheaded 
it was definitely her 
she's done this before 
i was thorough this time 
it would take 
sherlock holmes to fool me 
and i don't think 
he was on hand do you 
so 
what shall we tell sherlock 
clearly you've got news 
if it's about the leeds triple 
murder it was the gardener 
did nobody notice the earring hi 
er no it's um it's about 
irene adler 
well 
something happened 
has she come back 
no she's i bumped into mycroft 
downstairs he had to take a call 
is she back in london 
no 
she's er 
she's in america 
america 
got herself on a witness protection 
scheme apparently 
don't know how she swung it 
but well you know 
i know what you won't be able 
to see her again 
why would i want to see her again 
didn't say you did 
is that her file yes i was going 
to take it back to mycroft 
do you want to no 
listen actually 
but i will have 
the camera-phone though 
there's nothing on it it's been 
stripped i know but i 
i'll still have it 
i've got to give this back to 
mycroft you can't keep it 
sherlock i have to give this to 
mycroft it's the government's now 
please 
thank you 
well i'd better take this back 
yes 
did she ever text you again 
after all that 
once a few months ago

start from the beginning 
i woke up 
how did you sleep 
i didn't i don't 
you just said you woke up 
i stopped lying down 
of course alone 
i meant rosie your daughter 
uh she's with friends 
why 
can't always cope 
and last night wasn't good 
it's understandable 
is it why 
why is it understandable 
why does everything have to be 
understandable 
why can't some things be unacceptable 
and we can just say that 
i only mean it's okay 
i'm letting my daughter down 
how the hell is that okay 
you just lost your wife 
and rosie just 
lost her mother 
so there is no one you 
talk to confide in 
no one 
oh i'm picking up rosie 
this afternoon 
after i see my therapist 
got a new one 
i'm seeing her today 
are you gonna 
tell her about me 
no 
why not 
because i can't you know i can't 
she thinks you're dead 
john you've got to remember 
it's important 
i am dead 
please for your own sake 
and for rosie's 
this isn't real i'm dead 
i'm not here 
you know that don't you 
okay i'll see you later 
no 
what are you looking at 
nothing 
you keep glancing to my left 
oh i suppose i was 
just looking away 
there is a difference between 
looking away and looking to 
now i am reminding you 
of your friend i think 
that's not necessarily 
a good thing 
do you talk to sherlock holmes 
i haven't seen him 
no one's seen him he's locked himself away 
in his flat god knows what he's up to 
do you blame him 
i don't blame him 
i don't think about him 
has he attempted to 
make contact with you 
no 
how can you be sure 
he might have tried 
no if sherlock holmes 
wants to get in touch 
that's not something you 
can fail to notice 
well now 
won't you introduce me 
hello 
mr smith whenever you're ready 
now please 
bring them through 
it's difficult having such 
good friends 
friends are people 
you want to share with 
friends and family 
what's the very worst 
thing you can do 
to your very best friends 
something on your mind 
yes simon oh yes 
whatever you tell us stays in this room 
i think i speak for everyone 
well what is the worst 
thing you could do 
tell them your darkest secret 
because 
if you tell them and they decide 
they rather not know 
you can't take it back 
you can't unsay it 
once you've opened your heart 
you can't close it again 
i'm kidding 
of course you can 
well everyone please 
roll up your right sleeves 
roll up your right sleeves 
come on 
oh it's a bit of insurance 
i don't understand 
what is that 
td 12 
we make it my company td 12 
sells mainly to dentists and hospitals 
for minor surgical procedures 
interferes with 
yes 
i want to thank you ivan 
for allowing me to use it 
didn't exactly know who 
you were gonna be using it on 
roll up your sleeves 
come on roll up 
this is obscene 
all i'm doing faith dear 
off my chest 
without getting it on yours 
what you're about to hear 
me say may horrify you but 
you will forget it 
if you think about it 
civilisation has always 
depended on a measure 
of elective ignorance 
these drip feeds will keep the drug in 
your blood streams at exactly the right levels 
nothing that is 
happening to you now 
will stay with you for more 
than a few minutes 
i'm afraid that some of the 
memories you've had up to 
this point might also be 
i'm going to share 
something with you now 
something personal 
and of importance to me 
i have a need to confess 
but you i think 
might have a need to forget 
by the end of this you'll be 
free to go and don't worry 
by the time you're back 
in the outside world 
you will not remember any 
of what you've heard 
some of you know each other 
and some of you don't 
please be aware 
that one of you 
is a high ranking 
police officer 
one of you is a 
member of the judiciary 
one of you sits on the board 
of a prominent broadcaster 
two of you work for me 
and one of you of course is my lovely daughter 
faith 
you are the people 
i need to hear me 
i have made millions for myself 
for the people around this table 
for millions of people 
i've never even met 
there are charities that i support 
who wouldn't exist without me 
if life is a balance sheet 
and i think it is 
well i believe i'm in credit 
but i have a situation 
that needs to be managed 
i have a problem and there is 
only one way that i can solve it 
and what's that 
i'm terribly sorry 
i need to kill someone 
who 
need to kill someone faith 
three years ago my father told me 
he wanted to kill someone 
one word mr holmes 
and it changed 
my world forever 
just one word 
what word 
i can't remember 
i can't remember who 
my father wanted to kill 
and i don't know 
if he ever did it 
you've changed you need to top up 
your tan and your roots are showing 
you're letting yourself go 
do you ever look in the mirror 
and want to see someone else 
no do you own 
an american car 
left hand drive 
that's what i mean 
no why do you ask 
not sure actually 
probably just noticed something 
are you okay 
of course you don't own a car you don't need one 
do you living in isolation 
no human contact no visitors 
okay how do you know that 
it's all here isn't it look 
cost cutting is clearly 
a priority for you 
look at the size of your 
kitchen teeny-tiny 
must be a bit annoying when 
you're such a keen cook 
i don't understand 
hang on a minute i was looking out 
of the window why was i doing that 
it'll come back to me 
presumably you downsized 
when you left your job 
and maybe when 
you ended your relationship 
there wasn't anything physical 
going on was there 
quite some time in fact 
there see it's obvious 
you can't tell things like 
that from a piece of paper 
sort of happens 
like a reflex 
i can't stop it 
coat 
go to the police they're really 
excellent at dealing with this 
complicated sort of stuff 
tell them i sent you 
that ought to get a reaction 
night-night 
please i have no one 
else to turn to 
yes but i'm very busy at the moment 
i have to drink a cup of tea 
this cup of tea 
because you might 
prefer some coffee 
you're my last hope 
really that's bad luck isn't it 
good night go away 
what's bad luck 
stop talking it makes me 
aware of your existence 
i've always had bad luck 
that's not rude congenital 
it just means 
handbag 
stop wait 
your life is not your own 
keep your hands off it do you hear me 
off it off it 
sorry what 
what are you talking about 
look at the hem of it 
that's what i noticed sorry 
i'm still catching up with 
my brain it's terribly fast 
those markings 
do you see them 
you only get marks like that by 
trapping the hem of your skirt 
in a car door but they're on 
the left hand side 
so you weren't driving 
you were in the passenger seat 
i came in a taxi 
there is no taxi waiting 
in the street outside 
that's what i checked when 
i went to the window 
and you've got 
all the way to the door 
and not made any move to phone 
for one and look at you 
you didn't even bring 
a coat in this rain 
now that might mean 
nothing except 
the angle of the scars 
on your left forearm 
you know under that sleeve 
you keep pulling down 
i don't really need to check 
that the angles are consistent 
with self-harm do i 
i want to see your handbag 
why 
it's too heavy 
you said i was your last hope 
and now you're going out into the night 
with no plan on 
how you're getting home 
and a gun 
you're suicidal 
you're allowed chips 
trust me 
it's about the only perk 
sherlock 
are you going out 
i think i remember the way 
it's through there isn't it 
oh you're in a state 
look at you 
yeah well i've got 
a friend with me so 
oh 
come on 
for god's sake i was talking 
to the prime minister 
i'm sorry mr holmes 
it's your brother 
he's left his flat 
was it on fire 
you see the fold in the middle 
for the first few months 
you kept this hidden 
folded inside a book 
must have been a tightly 
packed shelf 
going by the severity 
of the crease 
so obviously you were keeping 
it hidden from someone 
living in the same house 
at the level of intimacy 
where privacy could not be assumed 
conclusion relationship 
not any more though 
there's a pin prick at the top of the paper 
the past few months 
it's been on open display on a wall 
conclusion 
relationship is over 
the paper has been exposed to steam 
and a variety of cooking smells 
so it must have been 
on display in the kitchen 
lots of different spices 
you're suicidal alone and strapped for cash 
yet you're still cooking 
to impress 
you're keen and kitchen is the 
most public room in any house 
and since any visitor could be expected 
to ask about a note like this 
i have to assume 
you don't have any 
you've isolated yourself 
i meant the chips 
hmm 
let's go for a walk 
you should answer it 
it's mycroft 
might be about sherlock 
of course it's about sherlock 
everything's about sherlock 
the fading pattern 
on the paper it's not much 
but it's enough to know your 
kitchen window faces east now 
kitchen notice boards 
by instinct we place them at eye level 
where there's natural light 
now look the sun's only struck 
the bottom two-thirds 
but the line is straight so that means 
we know paper is facing the window 
but because the top section 
is unaffected 
we know the sunlight can only be 
entering the room at a steep angle 
if the sunlight 
was able to penetrate the room 
when the sun 
was lower in the sky 
then the paper 
would be equally faded 
top to bottom but no 
it only makes it when the sun 
is at its zenith 
so i'm betting that you live in 
a narrow street on the ground floor 
now if steeply angled 
sunlight manages to hit 
eye level on the wall 
opposite the window 
then what do we know 
about the room 
the room's small 
we can keep tabs 
you didn't have to come in 
i was talking to 
the prime minister 
oh i see 
what's he doing 
why is he just wandering 
about like a fool 
she died mycroft 
he's probably still in shock 
everybody dies 
that's the one thing human beings 
can be relied upon to do 
how can it still come 
as a surprise to people 
you sound cross 
am i going to be taken 
away by security again 
i have i think 
apologised extensively 
you haven't made it up to me 
and how am i supposed to do that 
sex how did you know 
i wasn't getting any 
it's all about the blood 
this one comes from the very first night 
you can see the pen marks over it 
i think you discovered the pains stimulated 
your memory so you tried it again later 
i'm no expert but i assume that 
since your lover failed to notice 
an increasing number of scars 
over a period of months 
that the relationship 
was no longer intimate 
how do you know 
he didn't notice 
oh well 'cause he would 
have done something about it 
this way 
what plan 
what is it what now 
sorry um traced 
his route to the map 
is he with someone 
not sure 
we keep losing visual 
mostly we're tracking his phone 
i'm trying to sleep can you 
stop ringing my damn phone 
that's very touching 
how you can hijack 
the machinery of the state 
to look after your own family 
can i go to sleep now 
sherlock gone rogue is a 
legitimate security concern 
the fact that i'm his brother 
changes absolutely nothing 
it didn't the last time 
and i assure you it won't 
with sherlock 
sorry what 
please phone me if he 
gets in contact thank you 
do you still speak to sherrinford 
sherrinford is secure 
it's a long word 
culverton smith all this charity work 
what's in it for you 
we must be careful 
not to burn our bridges 
do you know why 
i'm gonna take your case 
because of the one 
impossible thing you said 
what impossible thing 
you said your life 
turned on one word 
yes 
the name of the person 
my father wanted to kill 
that's the impossible thing 
names are not one word 
they're always at least two 
sherlock holmes faith smith 
santa claus 
winston churchill 
napoleon bonaparte actually 
just napoleon would do 
or elvis 
look i think we can rule 
both of them out as targets 
okay i got it wrong then 
it wasn't on one word it can't have been 
did you remember quite distinctly 
that your whole life 
turned on one word 
so that happened i don't doubt it 
but how can that word be a name 
a name you instantly recognise 
that tore your world apart 
okay well how 
no idea yet 
but i don't work for free 
you take cash 
not cash no 
taking your own life 
interesting expression 
taking it from who 
once it's over 
it's not you who'll miss it 
you know death it's something 
that happens to everybody else 
your life is not your own 
keep your hands off it 
you're not what i expected you're 
sorry i 
faith faith 
who 
anyone 
of course 
he doesn't want to kill one person 
he wants to kill anyone 
he's a serial killer 
anyone 
why not 
why shouldn't he be 
do you know where you are 
are you drunk 
what were you doing in the 
middle of a bloody street 
they found your address 
they brought you here 
you've had too much 
and that's me saying it 
they're always poor 
and lonely and strange 
serial killers 
but if you are rich 
and powerful and necessary 
what if you had the compulsion 
to kill and money what then 
well now 
won't you introduce me 
ah 
right you there 
stop right where you are 
do you have any idea what 
speed you were going at 
of course not

of course i didn't call the police 
i'm not a civilian 
these pictures 
they're that man on the telly aren't they 
oh these pictures 
oh you can see them too that's good 
culverton smith this i think 
is relevant from this morning 
he's publicly accused mr smith 
of being a serial killer 
christ sherlock on twitter 
he really has lost it 
don't you dare make jokes don't you dare 
i was terrified 
a cup of tea 
oh for goodness' sakes 
what's the matter with you 
are you having an earthquake 
he needs you 
somebody else 
not me not now 
now you just listen to me 
for once in your stupid life 
i know mary's dead and i know 
your heart is broken 
but if sherlock holmes dies 
too who'll you have then 
because i'll tell you 
something john watson 
you will not have me 
have you spoken to mycroft 
molly anyone 
they don't matter you do 
would you just see him 
please john 
or just take a look at him 
as a doctor 
i know you'd change your mind 
if you did 
yeah look okay 
maybe if i get a chance 
promise me 
well on you go 
examine him 
right then mister 
now i need your handcuffs 
i happen to know there's a pair 
in the salad drawer 
i've borrowed them before 
oh get over yourself 
you're not my first 
smack-head sherlock holmes 
that woman's out of control 
i asked for a cup of tea 
they dropped me twice 
and you know why 
they dropped you dear 
because they know you 
who's this one 
is this a new person 
i'm against new people 
excuse me for a moment 
she's my therapist 
awesome do you do 
block bookings 
whose car is that 
oh for god's sake 
i'm the widow of a drug dealer 
i own property in central london 
and for the last 
bloody time john 
i'm not your housekeeper 
i'm so sorry 
i answered your phone you were busy 
i think you'll want to take it 
yeah who's this 
culverton smith 
you've probably heard of me 
uh well yes 
get me a fresh glass of water please 
this one's filthy 
i mean i'm aware of 
this morning's developments 
yes i'm sure 
he was being hilarious 
sorry did you say 
all still meeting 
i sent a car 
it should be outside 
mr holmes gave me an address 
well he couldn't have 
given you this one 
when you're ready 
when did sherlock 
give you this address 
how did you know 
where to find me 
oh sherlock told me 
he's not so difficult 
when you've got a gun on him 
how did you know how 
on monday i decided 
to get a new therapist 
tuesday afternoon i chose her 
wednesday morning i booked today's session 
now today is friday 
so two weeks ago two weeks 
before you were abducted at gunpoint 
and brought here against your will 
over a week before i even 
thought of coming here 
you knew exactly where you need 
to be picked up for lunch 
really 
i correctly anticipated the responses of 
people i know well to scenarios i devised 
except the boot 
the boot was mean 
never mind how he's dying to tell us that 
i want to know why 
because mrs hudson's right 
i'm burning up 
i'm at the bottom of a pit and i'm 
still falling and i'm never climbing out 
i need you to know john 
i need you to see that up here 
i've still got it 
so when i tell you that 
this is the most dangerous 
the most despicable human being 
that i have ever encountered 
when i tell you that 
this monster must be ended 
please remember 
where you're standing 
because you're standing exactly where 
i said you would be two weeks ago 
i'm a mess i'm in hell 
but i am not wrong not about him 
so what has all this 
got to do with me 
that creature 
that rotting thing 
is a living breathing 
coagulation of human evil 
if the only thing i ever do 
in this world is drive him out of it 
then my life will not 
have been wasted 
look at me 
can't do it not now 
not alone 
uh 
yeah well they're real 
enough i suppose 
why would i be faking 
because you're a liar 
you lie all the time it's like your mission 
i have been many things john 
but when have i ever been a malingerer 
you pretended to be dead 
for two years 
i need to know 
what state you're in 
well you're a doctor 
examine me 
no i need a second opinion 
john calm down 
when have you ever managed 
two opinions you'd fall over 
i need the one person who 
unlike me learnt to see 
through your bullshit long ago 
who's that then i'm sure 
i would have noticed 
the last person you'd think of 
i want you to be examined 
by molly hooper 
do you hear me 
i said molly hooper 
you're really 
not gonna like this 
like what 
oh hello is er 
i'm sorry 
sherlock asked me to come 
what two weeks ago 
yeah about two weeks 
okay fully equipped ambulance 
molly can examine me on the way to save time 
hope you remembered my coat 
sorry i didn't know 
that you were gonna be here 
oh god well um 
just check him out 
is molly the right person 
to be doing medicals 
she's more used to dead people 
it's bound to lower your standards 
i don't know i don't know 
anything any more 
no you're going to have to 
buck up a bit john 
you know that don't you 
the game is on 
i'll do my best 
anything you need 
anytime just ask 
anything at all 
thank you 
uh sometimes 
can i borrow your car 
he knew you'd get 
a new therapist after i died 
because you'd need 
to change everything 
that's just what you're like 
thanks 
you keep your weekends for rosie 
so you needed to see someone 
during working hours 
because you're an idiot 
you don't want anyone at the surgery 
knowing you're in therapy 
so that restricts you 
to lunchtime sessions 
with someone reasonably close 
you found four men 
and one woman 
and you are done with the world 
being explained to you by a man 
who isn't 
so all he needed to do was find the 
first available lunchtime appointment 
with a female therapist within 
cycling distance of your surgery 
i'm in your head john 
you're disagreeing with yourself 
he is the cleverest man in the world 
but he's not a monster 
but he's our monster 
i'm a killer 
you know i'm a killer 
but did you know 
uh was that me 
was i too good huh 
he's here 
well how is he 
basically fine 
i've seen healthier people 
on the slab 
yeah but to be fair you work with 
murder victims they tend to be quite young 
if you keep taking what you're taking 
at the rate you're taking it 
you've got weeks 
exactly weeks 
let's not get ahead of ourselves 
for christ's sake sherlock 
it's not a game 
i'm worried about you molly 
you seem very stressed 
i'm stressed 
you're dying 
yeah well i'm ahead then 
stress can ruin every day of your life 
you've really lost it 
you're actually out of control 
clever boy missed you 
fumbling around the place 
trick 
course it's not a trick 
it's a plan 
mr holmes 
thirty feet and closing the most 
significant undetected serial killer 
in british criminal history 
help me bring him down 
mr holmes 
i don't do handshakes 
oh sherlock 
oh sherlock 
what can i say thanks to you 
we're uh we're everywhere 
mr holmes how did culverton 
talk you into this 
well he he's a detective 
maybe i just confessed 
come on 
now it's uh 
it's a new kind 
of breakfast cereal 
mr holmes can you put on the hat 
yeah he doesn't really 
wear the hat 
kids will be getting two of their 
five-a-day before they've even left home 
sherlock's been amazing for us 
breakfast has got to be cool 
we're beyond viral 
you know what makes it cool 
when you're a kid 
what sorry 
beyond what 
dangerous 
and action 
i'm a killer 
you know i'm a killer 
but did you know 
i'm a cereal killer 
mmm 
and cut there thank you 
you should bag that up 
sell it 
make money from that on ebay 
you can make more 
if you like anytime you like 
has it occurred to you 
anywhere in your drug-addled brain 
that you've just been played 
oh yes 
brilliant 
safest place to hide 
plain sight 
mr holmes 
culverton wants to know if you're 
okay going straight to the hospital 
the kids would love 
to meet you both 
i think he's sort of promised 
oh okay 
if you'd just like 
to come this way 
so 
what are we doing here 
what's the point 
i needed a hug 
what do you think mr holmes 
cereal killer 
it's funny 'cause it's true 
see you at the hospital 
oh you can have this back now 
oh i sent and deleted a text 
you might get a reply but i doubt it 
we're going to have endless fun 
mr holmes aren't we 
no 
no not endless 
need another hit do you 
it can wait until the hospital 
you involved much 
sorry 
um with mr holmes 
sherlock and all his cases 
yeah i'm john watson 
okay 
dr watson 
say what you like about addiction 
the day is full of highlights 
oh mr holmes 
you're feeling better 
psychedelic 
i was just saying 
i love your blog 
it is he writes the blog 
it's gone downhill a bit hasn't it 
it's this way then 
oh my god i love your blog 
you're welcome 
right here he comes 
the internet tech 
you all know sherlock holmes 
oh and dr watson of course 
mr holmes i was wondering 
well we all were weren't we 
maybe you could tell us 
about some of your cases 
yes absolutely yes 
the main feature of interest in 
the field of criminal investigation 
is not the sensational aspects 
of the crime itself 
but rather the iron chain 
of reasoning from cause to effect 
that reveals step-by-step 
the solution 
that's the only truly remarkable aspect 
of the entire affair 
now i will share with you the facts 
and evidence as they were available to me 
and in this very room 
you will all attempt to solve the 
case of blessington the poisoner 
i think you slightly 
gave away the ending 
it's more about how he did it 
drearcliff house 
remember that one john one murder 
and what do you 
call that one john 
um something to do 
with murder at the zoo 
yeah i called it 
or was it the case of 
the killer orangutan 
he should be wearing the hat 
the kids would love the hat 
how do you capture 
a serial killer 
same way you catch 
any other killer 
no no but most killers 
kill someone they know 
you're looking for a murderer 
in a tiny social grouping 
um mr smith 
um i'm just uh wondering 
maybe this isn't a suitable subject 
for the children 
nurse cornish 
seven years 
okay 
serial killers choose 
their victims at random 
surely that must 
make it more difficult 
some of them advertise 
do they really 
serial killing is an 
expression of power ego 
a signature 
in human destruction 
ultimately for full satisfaction 
it requires plain sight 
additionally serial killers 
are easily profiled 
they tend to be social outcasts 
you're just talking about the ones you know 
the ones you've caught 
but hello dummy 
you only catch the dumb ones 
now imagine if the queen wanted to 
kill some people what would happen then 
all that power all that money 
sweet little government 
dancing attendants 
a whole country 
just to keep her warm and fat 
hmm 
we all love the queen don't we 
and i bet she'd love you lot 
it's all right everyone 
i can personally assure you 
that sherlock holmes is not 
about to arrest the queen 
well of course not 
not her majesty 
money power fame 
some things make you untouchable 
god save the queen 
she could open a slaughterhouse 
and we'd all probably 
pay the entrance fee 
no one's untouchable 
no one 
look at you all 
so gloomy can't you take a joke 
the queen 
if the queen was a serial killer 
i'd be the first person she'd tell 
we have that kind of friendship 
a big round of applause for 
sherlock holmes and dr watson 
come on 
wonderful 
thank you so much for coming 
thank you 
no let's go in here 
so have you had another one 
of your little meetings 
oh it's just a monthly top-up 
confession is good for the soul 
it's a memory inhibitor 
bliss 
bliss 
opt-in ignorance 
makes the world go round 
anyone ever opt to remember 
some people take the drip out 
yes some people have the same urges 
now come on wasting time 
indeed you have 
i estimate 20 minutes left 
it was read almost immediately 
factoring in a degree of shock 
and emotional decision and a journey time 
based on the associated address 
i'd say that your life as you know it 
has 20 minutes left to run 
well no 17 and a half to be precise 
but i rounded up for dramatic effect 
so please do show us 
your favourite room 
it'll give you a chance 
to say good-bye 
come along 
the game is on 
do you still miss me 
speaking of serial killers 
you know who's my favourite 
other than yourself 
hh holmes 
relative of yours 
not as far as i know 
you should check 
what an idiot 
everyone out 
mr smith we're actually 
in the middle of something 
saheed isn't it 
saheed yes 
four years 
well that's a long time isn't it 
four years 
okay everyone 
saheed 
this time knock 
how can you do that 
how how are you even allowed in here 
oh i can go anywhere i like 
anywhere at all 
they gave you keys 
they presented them to me 
there was a ceremony 
you can watch that on youtube 
the home secretary was there 
so your favourite room 
the mortuary 
what do you think 
tough crowd 
oh i don't know 
you know i've always 
found them quite pliable 
don't do that 
she's fine 
she's dead 
hh holmes loved the dead 
he mass-produced them 
serial killer active 
during the chicago fair 
you know what he did 
he built a hotel a special hotel 
just to kill people 
you know with a hanging room 
gas chamber specially adapted furnace 
you know like sweeney todd 
stupid 
so stupid 
why stupid 
well all that effort 
you don't build a beach if you want to 
hide a pebble you just find a beach and 
if you wanna hide a murder 
you wanna hide lots and lots of murders 
just find a 
hospital 
can we be clear 
are you confessing 
to what 
the way you're talking 
oh sorry 
yes 
you mean am i a serial killer 
or am i just trying to mess 
with your funny little head 
well it's true 
i do like to mess with people and yes 
i am a bit creepy but that's just my usp 
i use it to sell 
breakfast cereal 
but am i what he says i am 
is that what you're asking 
well let me ask you this 
oh well no a medical doctor 
you know not just feet or 
media studies or something 
i'm a doctor 
are you serious 
no really 
are you 
are you are you 
actually serious 
i've played along 
with this joke 
it's not funny any more 
you know look at him 
go ahead look at him 
dr watson hmm 
oh no i'll lay it 
out for you 
there are two possible explanations 
for what's going on here 
either i'm a serial killer 
or sherlock holmes is 
off his tits on drugs hmm 
delusional paranoia 
about a public personality 
that's not so special 
it's not even new 
i think you need to tell 
your faithful little friend 
how you're wasting his time 
because you're too high 
to know what's real any more 
i apologise 
i miscalculated 
i forgot to 
factor in the traffic 
nineteen and a half minutes 
ah the footsteps you're about to hear 
will be very familiar to you 
not least because there'll be 
three impacts rather than two 
the third of course will be 
the end of a walking cane 
your daughter faith's 
walking cane 
why would she be here 
you invited her 
you sent her a text 
or or or 
technically i sent her a text 
but she's not to know 
um let's see if i can recall 
how would that 
have any effect 
you don't know her 
oh but i do 
i spent a whole evening with her 
we had chips 
i think she liked me 
you don't know faith 
you simply do not 
i know you care 
about her deeply 
i know you invited her to one 
of your special board meetings 
you care what she thinks 
you maintain an impressive facade 
i think it's about to break 
did you know 
of course i didn't 
she came to see me 
because she was scared 
of her daddy 
never happened is this another one 
of your drug-fuelled fantasies 
well let's see shall we 
faith stop loitering 
at the door and come in 
this is your father's 
favourite room 
come and meet his best friends 
faith: dad what's happening 
what was that text 
another one of your jokes 
who are you 
who the hell are you 
sherlock holmes 
surely you recognise him 
oh my god 
sherlock holmes 
i love your blog 
you're not her you're not the woman 
who came to baker street 
erm well no 
never been there 
well there must've been some build-up 
he didn't just suddenly do it 
look i didn't know 
he had the bloody scalpel 
sorry i'm not sure 
i completely understand 
no we've never met 
oh dear 
have we 
sherlock 
so who came to my flat 
well it wasn't me 
you look different 
i wasn't there 
who came to my flat 
i don't think i've ever been 
anywhere near your flat 
oh dear oh no 
oh no 
faith 
oh god come on 
sherlock 
sherlock you all right 
sherlock you okay 
got a scalpel you picked it up 
from that table i saw you take it 
i certainly did not 
look behind his back 
sherlock 
christ 
i keep wondering if we 
should've seen it coming 
not long ago he shot 
charles magnussen in the face 
we did see it coming 
we always saw it coming 
but it was fun 
you probably wanna see this 
stop laughing at me 
sherlock 
stop it stop it now 
he's right you know 
you probably saved his life 
what are you doing wake up 
i really hit him greg 
hit him hard 
is this a game 
a bloody game 
please please please 
no violence 
thank you dr watson 
i don't think he's 
a danger any more 
leave him be 
no 
it's okay 
let him do what he wants 
he's entitled 
i killed his wife 
yes you did 
oh hi 
just in to say hello 
no i'm just in to say goodbye 
i'm sure he'll pull through 
yeah he's made a terrible 
mess of himself 
but he's awfully strong so 
we must look on the bright side 
well 
parting gift 
aww that's nice 
a walking stick 
yeah it was mine from 
a long time ago 
hello ward 73 
oh uh dr watson 
hmm 
it's for you 
hello mycroft 
you know he should 
definitely have worn the hat 
still thinking about sherlock 
no you are 
you've got your 
disapproving face on 
well seeing as i'm inside your head 
i think we can call that self-loathing 
where is she 
where is mrs hudson 
she'll be up in a moment 
have you noticed the kitchen 
it's practically a meth lab 
i'm trying to establish exactly what 
drove sherlock off the rails any ideas 
are these spooks 
are you using spooks now 
to look after your family 
hang on are they tidying 
sherlock is a security concern 
the fact that i'm his 
brother changes nothing 
why fixate on culverton smith 
he's had his obsessions 
before of course 
but this goes a 
bit further than 
setting a man trap 
for father christmas 
do it ask him 
spending all night talking to 
a woman who wasn't even there 
no no no stop 
i detest conversation in the past tense 
you said the fact that you're 
his brother made no difference 
it doesn't 
you said it didn't the last time 
and it wouldn't with sherlock 
nobody 
i misspoke 
i assure you i'm not 
he really is lying 
sherlock's not 
your only brother 
there's another one isn't there 
a secret brother 
what is he locked up in a tower or something 
mycroft holmes 
what are these dreadful 
people doing in my house 
mrs hudson i apologise 
for the interruption 
as you know my brother has embarked 
in a programme of self-destruction 
remarkable even by his standards 
and i'm endeavouring 
to find out what triggered it 
what's on his mind 
time being something of which 
we don't have an infinite supply 
so if we could be 
about our business 
you're so funny you are 
mrs hudson 
he thinks you're clever 
poor old sherlock 
always going on about you 
i mean he knows you're an idiot 
but that's okay 'cause 
you are a lovely doctor 
but he has no idea 
what an idiot you are 
is this merely stream 
of consciousness abuse 
or are you attempting 
to make a point 
you want to know what's 
bothering sherlock 
easiest thing in the world 
anyone can do it 
i know his thoughts processes 
better than any other human being 
so please try to understand 
he's not about thinking 
not sherlock 
unsolved case 
shoot the wall 
unmade breakfast 
karate the fridge 
unanswered questions 
well what does he do with anything 
he can't answer john 
every time 
he stabs it 
anything he can't find 
the answer for bang it's up there 
i keep telling you if he was any good 
as the detective i wouldn't need a new mantle 
okay no stop that now please 
everybody out now 
all of you 
this is my house this is my friend 
and that's his departed wife 
anyone who stays 
here a minute longer 
is admitting to me personally 
they do not have 
a single spark of human decency 
get out of my house 
you reptile 
you've been ages wakin' up 
i watched you 
it was quite lovely in its way 
take it easy it's okay 
i don't want to rush this 
you're sherlock holmes 
john you want to 
watch this later 
how did you get in 
policemen outside you mean 
come on can't you guess 
secret door 
i built this whole wing 
kept firing the architect 
who built it so no one 
knew quite 
how it all fitted together 
i can slip in and out 
whenever i like you know 
when i get the urge 
hh holmes 
murder castle but done right 
i have a question for you 
why you are here 
it's like you walked into my den 
and laid down in front of me 
why 
you know why i'm here 
i'd like to hear you say it 
say it for me please 
i want you to kill me 
john 
my car 
increase the dosage four 
five times the toxic shock 
should shut me down 
within about an hour 
then i'll restore the settings 
everyone assumes 
that it was a fault or 
you are good at this 
before we start 
tell me how you feel 
i 
i feel scared 
be more specific 
you only get to do 
this the once 
scared of dying 
you wanted this though 
i have reasons 
but you don't 
actually want to die 
no 
good 
say that for me 
and again 
i don't want to die 
once more for luck 
i don't want to die 
i don't 
i don't want to die 
lovely 
here it comes 
i don't know something 
mary left a message 
what message 
so tell me why 
are we doing this 
to what do i owe the pleasure 
i wanted to hear your confession 
needed to know i was right 
why do you need to die 
the mortuary 
your favourite room 
you talk to the dead 
you make your confession to them 
i'm sorry sir what 
what do you mean 
i think the door is jammed 
oh has that door 
locked itself again 
yeah it's always doing that 
why do you do it 
why do i kill 
it's not about hatred or revenge 
i'm not a dark person 
killing human beings 
it just makes me 
ah incredibly happy 
you know in films when 
you see dead people 
pretending to be dead and it's 
just living people lying down 
that's not what 
dead people are like 
dead people 
look like things 
i like to make people 
into things 
then you can own them 
you know what i'm getting 
a little impatient 
take a big breath if you want 
murder is a very difficult 
addiction to manage 
people don't realise how 
much work goes into it 
you have to be careful 
but if you're rich 
or and famous and loved 
it's amazing what people 
are prepared to ignore 
there's always someone desperate 
about to go missing 
and no one is supposed to suspect 
murder if it's easier to suspect 
something else 
i just have to ration myself 
choose the right heart to stop 
maintain eye contact 
maintain eye contact 
maintain eye contact 
i like to watch it happen 
and off we pop 
mr holmes you okay 
what were you doing to him 
what were you doing 
suffocating me 
well you see i got ms cornish 
to switch the bags 
she's a big fan you know 
loves my blog 
malnourished 
double kidney failure 
and frankly i've been 
off my tits for weeks 
what kind of doctor are you 
i got my confession 
though didn't i 
well i didn't recall 
making any confession 
what would i be confessing to 
oh mr holmes i don't know 
if this is relevant but 
we found three potential recording devices 
in the pockets of your coat 
all your possessions 
were searched sorry 
there must be something 
comforting about the number three 
people always 
give up after three 
what what is it what 
oh 
utter utter cock 
heard you the first time 
how does that open 
screw the top 
i'm that predictable 
no 
i'm just a cock 
it's funny 
never realised confessing 
would be so enjoyable 
should have done it sooner 
we'll carry on tomorrow 
well we could carry on now 
i'm not tired 
there's a loads more 
tomorrow 
you know 
i am gonna be so famous now 
you're already famous 
yeah but this 
i could break america 
and of course i hadn't 
been anticipated 
that i'd hallucinated 
meeting his daughter 
basically he trashed 
himself on drugs 
so that you'll help him 
so that you'd have something to do 
something doctory 
you get that now don't you 
still a bit troubled 
by the daughter 
did seem very real 
she gave me information i couldn't 
have acquired elsewhere 
but she wasn't ever here 
interesting isn't it 
i have theorised before 
that if one could attenuate to every available 
data stream in the world simultaneously 
it would be possible to anticipate 
and deduce almost anything 
hmm 
so you dreamed up a magic woman who 
told you things you didn't know 
that sounds about right to me 
possibly i'm biased 
perhaps the drugs opened 
certain doors in my mind 
which is why we're all taking it in 
turns to keep you off the sweeties 
i thought we were 
just hanging out 
molly will be here 
in 20 minutes 
oh i do think i can last 
twenty minutes without supervision 
well if you're sure 
christ john stay talk 
um sorry it's just uh 
you know rosie 
yes of course rosie 
go and solve a crime together 
make him wear the hat 
sorry i wasn't 
thinking of rosie 
i'll come and see you soon 
yes 
actually he should wear the hat 
as a special tribute to me 
i'm dead 
i would really appreciate it 
oh by the way the recordings 
will probably be inadmissible 
it might get thrown out as evidence 
not that that matters 
apparently he can't 
stop confessing 
are you okay 
no i'm not okay 
i'm never gonna be okay 
we just have to accept that 
it is what it is 
and what it is is 
you didn't kill mary 
mary died saving your life 
it's her choice 
no one made her do it 
no one could ever make her do anything 
but the point is 
you did not kill her 
in saving my life 
she conferred a value on it 
it is a currency i do not 
know how to spend 
it is what it is 
i'm tomorrow six till ten 
i'll see you then 
looking forward to it 
yeah 
hmm what was what 
that's the text alert of irene adler 
she's the scary mad one right 
that noise 
what noise 
she's dead 
oh i bet she isn't dead 
i bet he saved her 
oh my god 
oh the posh boy 
loves the dominatrix 
he's never knowingly 
under-cliched is he 
john 
i'm gonna make a deduction 
you're gonna be honest 
and tell me okay 
okay though i should mention that 
it is possible for any given text alert 
thank you john 
that's very kind of you 
never knew when 
your birthday was 
well now you do 
you and the woman do you go to a 
discreet harvester sometimes is there 
you bloody moron 
she's out there she likes you 
and she's alive 
and do you have the first idea 
how lucky you are 
yes she's a lunatic she's a criminal 
she's insanely dangerous 
trust you to fall 
for a sociopath 
oh married an assassin 
but she's you know 
is better than you are currently 
equipped to understand 
i once caught a triple 
poisoner in high wycombe 
that's only the beginning mate 
as i think i've explain to 
you many times before 
romantic entanglement 
while fulfilling for other people 
would complete you 
as a human being 
phone her do something 
while there's still a chance 
because that chance 
doesn't last forever 
trust me sherlock 
it's gone before you know it 
before you know it 
she was wrong about me 
mary how so 
she thought that if you put 
yourself in harm's way i'd 
i'd rescue you or something 
but i didn't 
not 'till she told me to 
and that's how this works 
that's what you're missing 
she taught me to be the man 
she already thought i was 
get yourself a piece of that 
look at me you are 
doing yourself a disservice 
i have known many people in this world 
but made few friends 
no clever comeback 
i cheated on you mary 
it was a woman on the bus 
and i had a plastic daisy in my hair 
i'd been playing with rosie 
and this girl just smiled at me 
that's all it was 
it was a smile 
we texted constantly 
you want to know when 
every time you left the room that's when 
when you're feeding our daughter 
when you were stopping her 
from crying that's when 
that's all it was 
just texting 
but i wanted more 
and you know something 
i still do 
i'm not the man 
you thought i was 
i'm not that guy 
i never could be 
but that's the point 
that's the whole point 
who you thought i was 
is the man who i want to be 
well then 
john watson 
get the hell on with it 
it's okay 
it's not okay 
no 
but it is what it is 
well i suppose a sugar high 
is some sort of substitute 
behave 
right then you know 
it's not my place to say but 
it was just texting 
people text even i text her 
i mean woman bad idea 
try not to but 
you know sometimes 
it's not a pleasant thought john 
but i have this terrible 
feeling from time to time 
that we might all just be human 
even you 
oh erm 
what what is it 
what's wrong 
seriously 
i'm sherlock holmes 
i wear the damn hat 
isn't that right mary 
you seem so much better john 
yeah i am i think i am 
not all day not every day 
but uh you know 
and rosie 
beautiful perfect 
unprecedented in the 
history of children 
and sherlock holmes 
back to normal 
i swear my wife 
is channelling satan 
yes boring go away 
given your immediate alternative 
what about his brother 
mycroft he's fine 
so you're off now 
i won't see you for a week 
just spending it at home 
unless she calls 
the pm 
my number 
i already have your number 
my private number 
why would i need that 
i don't know 
maybe you'd like a drink sometime 
of what 
up to you 
call me 
i mean obviously normal and 
fine are both relative terms 
when it comes to 
sherlock and mycroft 
obviously 
she was real 
but i didn't mean mycroft 
i mean the other one 
which other one 
you know the secret one 
oh that was just something 
i said i'm sure there's 
how did you know about that 
i didn't tell you that 
well maybe sherlock told me 
wait you've met sherlock 
exactly once in this room 
he was off his head 
we spent a night together 
it was lovely 
we had chips 
you're not 
what i expected mr holmes 
you're 
nicer 
culverton gave me 
faith's original note 
a mutual friend 
put us in touch 
did sherlock ever tell 
you about the note 
i added some deductions for sherlock 
he was quite good 
but he didn't get the big one 
in fairness though he does 
have excellent taste in chips 
the flower in your hair 
is like i had on the bus 
you looked very sweet 
but then 
you have such nice eyes 
amazing the times a man doesn't 
really look at your face 
oh you can hide behind a sexy smile 
or a walking cane 
or just be a therapist 
talking about you 
all the time 
oh please don't go anywhere 
i'm sure the therapist who actually lives here 
wouldn't want blood 
on the carpet 
oh hang on it's fine 
she's in a sack 
in the airing cupboard 
haven't you guessed 
i'm eurus 
eurus 
silly name isn't it greek 
means the east wind 
my parents loved silly names 
like eurus 
or mycroft 
or sherlock 
oh look at him 
didn't it ever occur to 
you not even once 
that sherlock's secret brother 
might just be sherlock's secret sister 
oh 
he's making a funny face 
i think i'll put a hole in it 
woman: the great artisans say 
the more the teapot is used 
the more beautiful it becomes 
the pot is seasoned by repeatedly 
pouring tea over the surface 
the deposit left on the clay creates 
this beautiful patina over time 
some pots the clay has been 
burnished by tea made 
over 400 years ago 
pa system: this museum will be 
closing in 10 minutes 
use it to make yourself a brew 
some things aren't supposed 
to sit behind glass 
they're made to be touched 
to be handled 
sighs 
these pots need attention 
the clay is cracking 
well i can't see how a tiny splash 
of tea is going to help 
sometimes 
you have to look hard at something 
to see its value 
see 
this one shines a little brighter 
i don't suppose 
um i mean 
i don't suppose 
that you want to have a drink 
not tea obviously 
um in a pub with me tonight 
um 
you wouldn't like me all that much 
can i maybe decide that for myself 
i can't 
i'm sorry

it's password protected 
in a manner of speaking took me 
less than a minute to guess yours 
not exactly fort knox 
right thank you 
siren wails 
oh 
need to get a job 
oh dull 
listen um 
sherlock are you listening 
i need to go to the bank 
yes when you said 
we were going to the bank 
door beeps 
elevator pings 
sherlock holmes 
phone rings 
sherlock holmes 
sebastian 
hiya buddy 
how long - eight years 
since i last clapped eyes on you 
this is my friend john watson 
friend colleague 
right 
phone ringing 
grab a pew 
do you need anything coffee water 
no we're all sorted here thanks 
so you're doing well 
you've been abroad a lot 
well so 
flying all the way 
around the world twice in a month 
scoffs 
right you're doing that thing 
we were at uni together and this guy 
here had a trick he used to do 
it's not a trick 
he could look at you 
and tell you your whole life story 
yes i've seen him do it put the 
wind up everybody we hated him 
we'd come down to breakfast 
in the formal hall 
and this freak would know you'd been 
shagging the previous night 
i simply observed 
go on enlighten me 
two trips a month 
flying all the way around the world 
you're quite right 
how could you tell are you going 
to tell me there's a stain on my tie 
from some special kind of ketchup 
you can only buy in manhattan 
no i 
is it the mud on my shoes 
i was just chatting with 
your secretary outside 
she told me 
laughs 
i'm glad you could make it over 
we've had a break-in 
sir william's office - 
the bank's former chairman 
the room's been left here 
like a sort of memorial 
someone broke in late last night 
what did they steal 
nothing 
just left a little message 
phone ringing 
electronic beep 
keyboard beeps 
so someone came up here 
in the middle of the night 
splashed paint around 
and left within a minute 
how many ways into that office 
well that's where this gets 
really interesting 
every door that opens in this bank 
it gets locked right here 
every walk-in cupboard every toilet 
that door didn't open last night 
there's a hole in our security 
find it and we'll pay you - 
five figures 
this is an advance 
tell me how he got in 
there's a bigger one on its way 
i don't need an incentive 
sebastian 
he's er 
clears throat 
shall i look after that for him 
thanks 
two trips around the world 
this month 
you didn't ask his secretary 
you said that just to irritate him 
how did you know 
did you see his watch 
his watch 
the time was right 
but the date was wrong 
said two days ago crossed the date 
line twice and he didn't alter it 
within a month 
how did you get that new breitling 
only came out this february 
ok so do you think we should 
sniff around here for a bit longer 
got everything i need 
to know already thanks 
that graffiti was a message 
someone at the bank 
working on the trading floors 
we find the intended recipient 
and 
they'll lead us to the person 
who sent it 
obvious 
well there's 300 people up there 
who was it meant for 
pillars what 
pillars and the screens 
very few places 
you could see that graffiti from 
that narrows the field considerably 
and of course the message was left 
at 1134 last night 
that tells us a lot 
does it 
traders come to work at all hours 
some trade with hong kong 
in the middle of the night 
that message was intended for 
somebody who came in at midnight 
not many van coons 
in the phone book 
taxi 
buzzes 
so what do we do now sit here 
and wait for him to come back 
just moved in what 
floor above new label 
could have just replaced it 
buzzes 
no-one ever does that 
woman: hello 
hi um i live in the flat just 
below you i don't think we've met 
no well er i've just moved in 
actually i've just locked 
my keys in my flat 
do you want me to buzz you in 
yeah and can we use your balcony 
what 
door buzzes 
watson: sherlock 
watson: sherlock are you ok 
yeah any time 
you feel like letting me in() 
do you think he'd lost a lot of 
money 
suicide is pretty common 
among city boys 
we don't know that it was suicide 
come on 
the door was locked from the inside 
you had to climb down the balcony 
been away three days 
judging by the laundry 
look at the case there was 
something tightly packed inside it 
thanks i'll take your word for it 
problem 
yeah i'm not desperate to root 
around some bloke's dirty underwear 
those symbols at the bank the 
graffiti why were they put there 
some sort of code obviously 
why were they painted want to 
communicate why not use e-mail 
well maybe he wasn't answering 
oh good you follow 
no 
what kind of a message 
would everyone try to avoid 
what about this morning 
those letters you were looking at 
bills 
yes he was being threatened 
man's voice in background 
not by the gas board 
dimmock: see if we can get prints 
off this glass 
sergeant we haven't met 
yeah i know who you are 
and i would prefer it if you didn't 
tamper with any of the evidence 
i phoned lestrade is he on his way 
he's busy i'm in charge 
and it's not sergeant 
it's detective inspector dimmock 
we're obviously 
looking at a suicide 
it does seem the only explanation 
of all the facts 
wrong it's one possible explanation 
of some of the facts 
you've got a solution that you like 
but you are choosing 
to ignore anything you see 
that doesn't comply with it 
like wound's on the right side of 
his head 
and van coon was left-handed 
requires quite a bit of contortion 
left-handed i'm amazed you 
didn't notice all you have to do 
is look around this flat 
coffee table on the left-hand side 
coffee mug handle 
pointing to the left 
power sockets habitually used 
the ones on the left pen and paper 
on the left of the phone 
picked up with his right 
took messages with his left 
d'you want me to go on 
no i think you've covered it 
i might as well i'm almost 
at the bottom of the list 
there's a knife on the breadboard 
with butter on the right side 
of the blade 
because he used it with his left 
it's highly unlikely 
that a left-handed man would shoot 
himself in the right of his head 
conclusion someone broke in here 
and murdered him - 
only explanation 
of all of the facts 
but the gun 
he was waiting for the killer 
he'd been threatened what 
today at the bank sort of a warning 
he fired a shot 
when his attacker came in 
and the bullet 
went through the open window 
oh come on() 
what are the chances of that 
wait until you get the ballistics 
report 
the bullet in his brain wasn't 
fired from his gun i guarantee it 
if his door was locked from the 
inside how did the killer get in 
good you're finally asking 
the right questions 
he's left trying to sort of 
cut his hair with a fork 
which of course can never be done 
it was a threat 
that's what the graffiti meant 
i'm kind of in a meeting 
can you make an appointment 
with my secretary 
i don't think this can wait 
sorry sebastian 
one of your traders someone who 
worked in your office was killed 
what van coon 
the police are at his flat 
killed 
sorry to interfere 
with everyone's digestion 
still want to make an appointment() 
would maybe nine o'clock 
at scotland yard suit 
harrow oxfordvery bright guy 
worked in asia for a while so 
you gave him the hong kong accounts 
lost 5 million in a single morning 
made it all back a week later 
nerves of steel eddie had 
who'd want to kill him 
we all make enemies 
you don't all end up with a bullet 
through your temple 
mobile rings 
not usually excuse me 
it's my chairman 
police have been on to him 
apparently they're telling him 
it was a suicide 
well they've got it wrong 
sebastian he was murdered 
well i'm afraid 
they don't see it like that 
so and neither does my boss 
i hired you to do a job 
don't get sidetracked 
fading footsteps 
i thought bankers were all supposed 
to be heartless bastards 
horn blares 
i need you to get over to crispians 
two ming vases up for auction - 
chenghua 
will you appraise them soo lin 
should go - she's the expert 
soo lin has resigned her job 
i need you 
phone ringing 
just locum work 
no that's fine 
you're um 
well you're a bit over-qualified 
er i could always do 
with the money 
well we've got two 
away on holiday this week 
and one's just left to have a baby 
it might be a bit mundane for you 
er no mundane is good sometimes 
mundane works 
it says here you were a soldier 
and a doctor 
anything else you can do 
i learned the clarinet at school 
oh 
laughs 
i said could you pass me a pen 
what when 
about an hour ago 
didn't notice i'd gone out then 
i went to see about a job 
at that surgery 
how was it 
great she's great 
who 
the job 
she 
it 
yeah have a look 
who can walk through walls" 
it happened last night 
journalist shot dead in his flat 
doors locked 
windows bolted from the inside 
exactly the same as van coon 
god you think 
he's killed another one 
brian lukis 
freelance journalist 
murdered in his flat 
doors locked from the inside 
you've got to admit 
it's similar 
both men killed by someone 
who can walk through solid walls 
inspector do you seriously believe 
that eddie van coon was 
just another city suicide 
sighs 
you have seen 
the ballistics report i suppose 
and the shot that killed him 
was it fired from his own gun 
no no 
so this investigation might move 
a bit quicker if you were 
to take my word as gospel 
i've just handed you 
a murder inquiry 
five minutes in his flat 
four floors up 
that's why they think they're safe 
put a chain across the door 
bolt it shut think they're 
impregnable 
they don't reckon for one second 
that there's another way in 
i don't understand dealing 
with a killer who can climb 
what are you doing 
clings to the walls like an insect 
clunk 
that's how he got in 
what 
he climbed up the side of the walls 
ran along the roof 
dropped in through this skylight 
you're not serious like spider-man 
he scaled six floors of a docklands 
apartment building 
jumped the balcony and killed 
van coon oh hold on() 
that's how he got into the bank - 
ran along the window ledge 
onto the terrace 
i have to find out 
what connects these two men 
date stamped on the book 
is the same day that he died 
sherlock 
so the killer goes to the bank 
leaves a threatening cipher 
at the bank 
van coon panics returns 
to his apartment locks himself in 
hours later he dies 
the killer finds lukis at the 
library he writes the cipher 
on the shelf where he knows 
it'll be seen lukis goes home 
late that night he dies too 
why did they die sherlock 
only the cipher can tell us 
the world's run on 
codes and ciphers john 
from the million-pound 
security system at the bank 
to the pin machine 
you took exception to cryptography 
inhabits our every waking moment 
yes ok but 
but it's all computer generated - 
electronic codes 
electronic ciphering methods 
this is different 
it's an ancient device 
modern code-breaking methods 
won't unravel it 
where are we headed 
i need to ask some advice 
what sorry 
you heard me perfectly 
i'm not saying it again 
you need advice 
on painting 
yes i need to talk to an expert 
siren wails 
part of a new exhibition 
interesting 
i call it 
urban bloodlust frenzy 
chuckles 
catchy() 
i've got two minutes before 
a community support officer 
comes around that corner 
can we do this while i'm working 
know the author 
i recognise the paint 
it's like michiganhard-core 
propellant 
i'd say zinc 
and what about the symbols 
do you recognise them 
i'm not even sure 
it's a proper language 
two men have been murdered raz 
deciphering this is the key 
to finding out who killed them 
and this is all you've 
got to go on() 
it's hardly much is it 
are you going to help us or not 
i'll ask around 
somebody must know something 
about it oi 
metallic clattering 
what the hell do you think you're 
doing this gallery is a listed 
public building 
no no wait wait 
it's not me who painted that 
i was just holding this for 
bit of an enthusiast are we 
police radio in background 
she was right in the middle of 
an important piece of restoration 
why would she suddenly resign 
family problems 
she said so in her letter 
but she doesn't have a family 
she came to this country on her own 
andy look those teapots 
those ceramics 
they've become her obsession 
she's been working on restoring them 
for weeks 
i can't believe 
that she would justabandon them 
perhaps she was getting 
a bit of unwanted attention 
door slams 
you've been a while 
yeah well you know how it is 
custody sergeants don't really 
like to be hurried do they 
just formalities fingerprints 
charge sheet and i've got to be 
in magistrates' court on tuesday 
what me sherlock 
in court on tuesday 
they're giving me an asbo 
good fine 
you want to tell your little pal 
he's welcome to go and own up 
any time 
this symbol i still can't place it 
no i need you to go 
to the police station 
and ask about the journalist 
the personal effects 
will have been impounded 
get hold of his diary or something 
that will tell us his movements 
go and see van coon's pa 
if you retrace their steps 
somewhere they'll coincide 
shutter clicks 
scotland yard 
flew back from dalian friday 
looks like he had back-to-back 
meetings with the sales team 
can you print me up a copy 
sure 
what about the day he died 
can you tell me where he was 
sorry i've got a gap 
i have all his receipts 
your friend 
listen whatever you say 
i'm behind you 100 per cent 
well that was mild 
people say a lot worse than that 
this is what you wanted isn't it 
the journalist's diary 
what kind of a boss was he amanda 
appreciative 
um no that's not a word i'd use 
the only things eddie appreciated 
had a big price tag 
like that hand cream 
he bought that for you didn't he 
look at this one 
got a taxi from him 
on the day he died £1850 
that would get him to the office 
not rush hour check the time 
mid-morning 18 would get him 
as far as the west end 
i remember him saying 
underground 
printed at one in piccadilly 
so he got a tube back to the office 
why would he get a taxi into town 
and then the tube back 
because he was delivering 
something heavy 
you wouldn't lug a package 
up the escalator 
delivering 
to somewhere near 
piccadilly station 
dropped the package 
delivered it and then 
stopped on his way he got peckish 
so you bought your lunch 
from here en route to the station 
but where were you headed from 
where did the taxi drop you 
oof right 
eddie van coon brought a package 
here the day he died 
whatever was hidden inside 
that case 
i've managed to piece 
together a picture 
using scraps of information - 
credit card bills receipts 
he flew back from china 
then he came here sherlock 
somewhere in this street somewhere 
near i don't know where but 
that shop over there 
how could you tell 
lukis' diary he was here too 
he wrote down the address oh 
shop bell rings 
hello 
you wantlucky cat 
no thanks no 
i think your wife she will like 
um thank you 
sherlock 
the label there 
yes i see it 
it's exactly the same as the cipher 
watson clears throat 
it's an ancient number system - 
hang zhou 
these days only street traders 
use it 
those were numbers written on the 
wall at the bank and at the library 
numbers written in 
an ancient chinese dialect 
it's a 15 
what we thought was the 
artist's tag it's a number 15 
and the blindfold the horizontal 
line that was a number as well 
the chinese number one john 
we found it 
two men travel back from china 
both head straight for 
the lucky cat emporium 
what did they see 
it's not what they saw 
it's what they both brought back 
in those suitcases 
and you don't mean duty free 
thank you 
think about what sebastian told us 
about van coon about 
how he stayed afloat in the market 
lost 5 million 
made it back in a week 
that's how he made such easy money 
he was a smuggler mm 
cover would have been perfect 
businessman 
making frequent trips to asia 
lukis was the same 
a journalist writing about china 
both of them smuggled stuff about 
the lucky cat was their drop-off 
but why did they die 
it doesn't make sense 
if they both turn up at the shop 
and deliver the goods 
why would someone threaten them 
and kill them after the event 
after they'd finished the job 
what if one of them 
was light-fingered 
how do you mean stole something 
something from the hoard 
the killer doesn't know 
which of them took it 
so threatens them both right 
remind me 
when was the last time 
that it rained 
it's been here since monday 
he rings doorbell 
no-one's been in that flat 
for at least three days 
could have gone on holiday 
do you leave your windows open 
when you go on holiday 
metallic screech 
sherlock 
groans 
water drips 
someone else has been here 
somebody else broke into the flat 
and knocked over the vase 
just like i did 
sniffs 
doorbell rings 
do you think maybe 
you could let me in this time 
can you not keep doing this please 
i'm not the first 
what 
somebody's been in here before me 
what are you saying 
size eight feet 
small butathletic 
i'm wasting my breath 
doorbell rings 
small strong hands 
our acrobat 
why didn't he close the window 
when he lef 
oh stupid stupid 
obvious 
he's still here 
chokes 
any time you want to include me 
john 
john 
oh i'm sherlock holmes 
and i always work alone 
because no-one else can compete 
with my massive intellect() 
doorbell rings 
splutters and coughs 
groans 
the milk's gone off 
and the washing's started to smell 
somebody left here in a hurry 
three days ago somebody 
soo lin yao we have to find her 
how exactly 
we could start with this 
you've gone all croaky 
are you getting a cold 
coughs 
i'm fine 
when was the last time 
that you saw her 
andy: three days ago 
here at the museum 
this morning they told me 
she'd resigned 
just like that 
left her work unfinished 
what was the last thing that she did 
on her final afternoon 
she does this demonstration 
for the tourists a tea ceremony 
so she would have packed up her 
things and just put them in here 
we have to get to soo lin yao 
if she's still alive 
sherlock 
oh look who it is 
found something you'll like 
tuesday morning 
all you've got to do is turn up 
and say the bag was yours 
forget about your court date 
girl: dude that was rad 
you want to hide a tree then a 
forest is the best place to do it 
wouldn't you say 
people would just walk 
straight past not knowing 
unable to decipher the message 
there i spotted it earlier 
they've been here 
and that's the exact same paint 
yeah 
john if we're going to 
decipher this code 
we need to look for more evidence 
answer your phone 
i've been calling you 
panting 
i found it 
it's been painted over 
i don't understand it was 
here 
a whole load of graffiti 
somebody doesn't want me to see it 
sherlock what are you doing 
ssh john concentrate 
i need you to concentrate 
close your eyes 
what why why what are you doing 
i need you to maximise 
your visual memory 
try to picture what you saw 
can you picture it yeah 
can you remember it 
yes definitely 
can you remember the pattern 
yes how much can you remember it 
look don't worry 
because the average human memory 
on visual matters 
is only 62% accurate 
well don't worry 
i remember all of it really 
at least i would if i could get 
to my pockets i took a photograph 
mobile beeps 
train rumbles 
always in pairs john look 
numbers 
come with partners 
god i need to sleep 
why did he paint it 
so near the tracks no idea 
thousands of people 
pass by there every day 
just 20 minutes 
of course 
of course he wants information 
he's trying to communicate 
with his people in the underworld 
whatever was stolen 
he wants it back 
it's somewhere here in a code 
we can't crack this 
without soo lin yao 
oh good 
two men who travelled back 
from china were murdered 
and their killer left them messages 
in hang zhou numerals 
soo lin yao is in danger 
that cipher it was just 
the same pattern as the others 
he means to kill her as well 
look i've tried everywhere - 
friends colleagues 
i don't know where she's gone 
i mean she could be 
a thousand miles away 
what are you looking at 
tell me more about those teapots 
the pots were her obsession 
they need urgent work 
if they dry out 
then the clay can start to crumble 
apparently you have to just 
keep making tea in them 
yesterday only one of those pots 
was shining 
now there are two 
grating 
fancy a biscuit with that 
centuries old 
don't want to break that 
hello 
you saw the cipher 
then you know he is coming for me 
you've been clever 
to avoid him so far 
i had to finish 
to finish this work 
it's only a matter of time 
i know he will find me 
who is he 
have you met him before 
when i was a girl we met in china 
i recognised his 
signature 
the cipher 
only he would do this zhi zhu 
zhi zhu the spider 
you know this mark 
yes it's the mark of a tong 
huh ancient crime syndicate 
based in china 
every foot soldier bears the mark 
everyone who hauls for them 
hauls 
you mean you were a smuggler 
i was 15 
my parents were dead 
i had no livelihood 
no way of surviving day-to-day 
except to work for the bosses 
who are they 
they are called the black lotus 
by the time i was 16 
i was taking 
thousands of pounds worth of drugs 
across the border into hong kong 
i managed to leave 
that life behind me 
i came to england 
they gave me a job here 
everything was good new life 
and he came looking for you 
yes 
i hoped after five years 
maybe they would have forgotten me 
but they never really let you leave 
a small community like ours 
he came to my flat 
he asked me to help him to track down 
something that was stolen 
and you've no idea what it was 
i refused to help 
so you knew him well 
when you were living back in china 
oh yes 
he's my brother 
two orphans 
we had no choice 
we could work for the black lotus 
or starve on the streets like 
beggars 
my brother has become their puppet 
in the power of the one 
they call shan 
the black lotus general 
i turned my brother away 
he said i had betrayed him 
next day i came to work 
and the cipher was waiting 
can you decipher these 
these are numbers yes i know 
here the line across the man's 
eyes it's the chinese number one 
and this one is 15 
but what's the code 
all the smugglers know it 
it's based upon a book 
door thuds 
he's here 
zhi zhu has found me 
no no sherlock 
sherlock wait 
come here 
get in get in 
gunshot 
second gunshot 
more gunshots 
i have to go and help him 
bolt the door after me 
gunshot 
gunshots 
careful 
gunshot 
some of those skulls are over 
have a bit of respect 
thank you 
liang 
speaks chinese 
speaks chinese 
gunshot 
oh my god 
gulps 
how many murders is it going to take 
before you start believing 
that this maniac's out there 
mutters 
a young girl was gunned down 
tonight 
that's three victims in three days 
you're supposed to be finding him 
brian lukis and eddie van coon 
were working for a gang 
of international smugglers 
a gang called the black lotus 
operating here in london 
right under your nose 
can you prove that 
what are you thinking 
pork or pasta oh it's you 
i suppose it's never going 
to trouble egon ronay is it 
i'd stick with the pasta 
don't want to be doing roast pork 
not if you're slicing up cadavers 
what are you having 
i don't eat when i'm working 
digesting slows me down 
so you're working here tonight 
need to examine some bodies some 
eddie van coon and brian lukis 
they're on my list 
could you wheel them out again 
for me 
welltheir paperwork's 
already gone through 
you changed your hair what 
the style 
it's usually parted in the middle 
yes well 
it's good 
itsuits you better this way 
we're just interested in the feet 
the feet yes 
do you mind if we have 
a look at them 
now van coon 
oh so 
so either these two men just 
happened to visit the same 
chinese tattoo parlour 
or i'm telling the truth 
what do you want 
i want every book from lukis' 
apartment and van coon's 
their books 
not just a criminal organisation 
it's a cult 
her brother was corrupted 
by one of its leaders 
soo lin said the name 
yes shan general shan 
we're still no closer to finding him 
wrong we've got almost 
all we need to know 
she gave us most of 
the missing pieces 
why did he need to visit his sister 
why did he need her expertise 
she worked at the museum 
exactly an expert in antiquities 
of course i see 
valuable antiquities john 
ancient chinese relics 
purchased on the black market 
china's home to a thousand treasures 
hidden after mao's revolution

john 
anonymous 
the vendor doesn't give his name 
from the east" 
one in lukis' suitcase 
and one in van coon's 
look here's another one 
arrived from china a month ago 
chinese ceramic statue sold for 
look a month before that 
chinese painting £500000 
all of them 
from an anonymous source 
they're stealing them back in china 
and one by one feeding them 
into britain 
every single auction coincides 
with lukis or van coon 
travelling to china 
so what if one of them got greedy 
when they were in china 
what if one of them stole something 
that's why zhi zhu's come 
knock at door 
sorry are we collecting 
for charity sherlock 
what 
a young man's outside 
with crates of books 
so the numbers are references 
to books 
to specific pages 
and specific words on those pages 
right so 
turn to page 15 
and it's the first word you read 
ok so what's the message 
depends on the book 
that's the cunning of the book code 
it has to be one that they both own 
ok fine this shouldn't take 
too long should it() 
we found theseat the museum

er we hoped soo lin 
could decipher it for us

to show for it 
other than a massive bill 
for overtime

you've seen the act before 
how dull for you

i'm not sherlock holmes 
i don't believe you 
you should you know 
sherlock holmes 
is nothing at all like him 
how would you describe me john 
resourceful dynamic enigmatic 
late 
that's a semi-automatic

the bullet will travel at 
over 1000 metres per second 
well

thump

exactly 
pouring liquid 
watson: ta 
so nine million million 
million yes nine million for 
jade pin dragon den black tramway 
an instruction 
to all their london operatives 
a message 
what they were trying to reclaim 
what a jade pin 
worth £9 million 
bring it to the tramway 
their london hideout 
hang on a hairpin worth £9 million 
apparently why so much 
depends who owned it 
two operatives based in london 
they travel over to dalian 
to smuggle those vases 
one of them helps himself 
to something a little hairpin 
worth £9 million 
eddie van coon was the thief 
he stole the treasure 
when he was in china 
how do you know it was van coon 
not lukis 
even the killer didn't know that 
because of the soap 
phone rings 
amanda 
holmes: he brought you a present 
oh hello 
a little gift 
when he came back from china 
how do you know that 
you weren't just his pa were you 
someone's been gossiping 
no then i don't understand why 
scented hand soap in his apartment 
sorry i don't think eddie 
van coon was the type of chap 
to buy himself hand soap 
not unless he had 
a lady coming over 
and it's the same brand as that 
hand cream there on your desk 
look it wasn't serious between us 
it was over in a flash 
it couldn't last he was my boss 
what happened why did you end it 
i thought he didn't appreciate me 
took me for granted 
stood me up once too often 
we'd plan to go away for the weekend 
and then he'd just leave 
fly off to china 
at a moment's notice 
and he brought you a present 
from abroad to say sorry 
can i just have a look at it 
he really climbed up 
onto the balcony 
nail a plank across the window 
and all your problems are over 
thanks 
he said he bought it 
in a street market 
oh i don't think that's true 
i think he pinched it 
yeah that's eddie 
didn't know its value 
just thought it would suit you 
oh what's it worth 
oh my god 
oh my god 
nine million 
over 1000 years old 
and it's sitting on her bedside table 
every night 
he didn't know its value didn't 
know why they were chasing him 
should've just got her a lucky cat 
you mind don't you what 
that she escaped general shan 
it's not enough 
that we got her two henchmen 
must be a vast network john 
thousands of operatives 
you and i 
we barely scratched the surface 
you cracked the code though 
sherlock 
and maybe dimmock can track down 
all of them now he knows it 
no no i crack this code 
all the smugglers have to do 
is pick up another book 
siren blares 
without you 
without your assistance 
we would not have found 
passage into london 
you have my thanks 
we did not anticipate 
we did not know this man would come 
this sherlock holmes 
and now your safety is compromised 
i will not reveal your identity

the beginning of all human misery 
that about arresting me 
you under close watch 
myself into the hands of the authorities 
searched thoroughly' 
mycroft 
mycroft 
why don't you come 
out and show yourself 
i don't have time for this 
we have time mycroft 
all the time in the world 
mycroft 
who are you 
you know 
impossible 
nothing's impossible 
you of all people know that 
it's coming to get you 
there's an east wind coming 
mycroft coming to get you 
you can't have got out you can't 
no use mycroft there's no 
defence and nowhere to hide 
y-a-a-a-argh 
sherlock help me 
experiment complete 
conclusion i have a sister 
this was you all of this was you 
conclusion two my 
sister eurus apparently 
has been incarcerated from an 
early age in a secure institution 
controlled by my brother 
hey bro 
why would you do this 
this pantomime why 
conclusion three you 
are terrified of her 
you have no idea what you're 
dealing with none at all 
new information she's out 
that's not possible 
it's more than possible 
she was john's therapist 
right you two wiggins has 
got your money by the gate 
don't spend it all in one crack den 
oh i hope we didn't spoil 
your enjoyment of the movie 
you're just leaving 
well we're not staying here 
eurus is coming and er 
someone's disabled all your security 
sleep well 
dr watson why would he do 
that to me that was insane 
er yes well someone convinced 
him that you wouldn't tell the truth 
unless you were actually 
wetting yourself 
someone 
probably me 
so that's it is it 
you're just going 
well don't worry there's 
a place for people like you 
the desperate the terrified 
the ones with nowhere else to run 
what place 
see you in the morning if 
there's a queue join it 
for god's sake this is 
not one of your idiot cases 
you might want to close that window 
there is an east wind coming 
you have to sit in the chair 
they won't talk to you unless you 
sit in the chair it's the rules 
she's not going to stay there is she 
the kettle's over there 
so what happens now are 
you going to make deductions 
you're going to tell the 
truth mycroft pure and simple 
who was it said "the truth is 
rarely pure and never simple" 
i don't know and i don't care 
so there were three 
of us i know that now 
you me and eurus 
a sister i can't remember 
interesting name eurus 
it's greek isn't it 
hm yeah literally 
the god of the east wind 
yes 
you used that to scare me 
into a ghost story 
of course i didn't i monitored you 
you what 
memories can resurface 
wounds can reopen 
the roads we walk have demons beneath 
and yours have been waiting 
for a very long time 
i never bullied you i 
used at discreet intervals 
potential trigger words 
to update myself as to 
your mental condition 
i was looking after you 
why can't i remember her 
so there were three holmes kids 
what was the age gap 
seven years between myself and sherlock 
one year between sherlock and eurus 
middle child explains a lot 
the deduction thing 
the deduction thing 
yes more than you can know 
enlighten me 
but eurus she was 
incandescent even then 
our abilities were professionally 
assessed more than once 
i was remarkable 
but eurus was described 
as an era-defining genius 
beyond newton 
then why don't i remember her 
you do remember her in a way 
every choice you ever made 
every path you've ever taken 
the man you are today 
she was different from the beginning 
she knew things she 
should never have known 
as if she was somehow aware of 
truths beyond the normal scope 
you look funny grown-up 
the memories are disturbing 
what do you mean examples 
they found her with a knife once 
she seemed to be cutting herself 
mother and father were terrified 
they thought it was a suicide attempt 
but when i asked eurus what 
she was doing she said: 
i wanted to see how my muscles worked 
she felt pain and she said: 
which one's pain 
then what happened 
musgrave 
the ancestral home where 
there was always honey for tea 
and sherlock played among the 
come on you lot 
they weren't real the 
dates were all wrong 
an architectural joke 
which fascinated sherlock 
and under we go 
you're starting to remember 
fragments 
redbeard redbeard 
eurus took redbeard and locked him 
up somewhere no-one could find him 
redbeard 
she'd only repeat that song 
her little ritual 
we begged and begged 
her to tell us where he was 
the song is the answer 
but the song made no sense 
but she started calling 
him drowned redbeard 
so we made our assumptions 
sherlock was traumatised 
natural i suppose he was in 
the early days an emotional child 
but after that he was 
different so changed 
never spoke of it again 
in time he seemed to forget 
that eurus had ever even existed 
how could he forget she was 
living in the same house 
no 
you don't lock up a child 
because a dog goes missing 
quite so 
it was what happened 
immediately afterwards 
she knows where he is 
we can't make her tell us 
we can't make her do anything 
after that our sister had 
oh some suitable place 
or so everyone thought 
not suitable enough however 
she started another fire 
one which she did not survive 
this is a lie 
yes 
it is also a kindness 
this is the story i told our 
parents to spare them further pain 
and to account for the absence 
of an identifiable body 
and no doubt to prevent 
their further interference 
well that too of course 
the depth of eurus's psychosis 
and the extent of her abilities 
couldn't hope to be contained 
in any ordinary institution 
uncle rudi took care of things 
where is she mycroft 
where's our sister 
there's a place called sherrinford 
an island 
it's a secure and very 
secret installation 
whose sole purpose is to contain 
what we call the uncontainables 
the demons beneath the road 
this is where we trap them 
sherrinford is more than 
a prison or an asylum 
it is a fortress 
built to keep the rest of the 
world safe from what is inside it 
heaven may be a fantasy for 
the credulous and the afraid 
but i can give you a 
map reference for hell 
that's where our sister has 
been since early childhood 
she hasn't left 
not for a single day 
whoever you both met 
it can't have been her 
what's it carrying 
what's that silver thing 
on top of it mycroft 
it's a dx-707 
i've authorised the purchase 
of quite a number of these 
colloquially it is known 
as the patience grenade 
patience 
the motion sensor has activated 
if any of us move the grenade 
it'll certainly destroy this 
flat and kill anyone in it 
assuming walls of reasonable strength 
your neighbours should be safe 
but as it's landed on the floor 
i am moved to wonder if 
the cafe below is open 
going by her usual routine i estimate 
she has another two minutes left 
she keeps the vacuum cleaner 
at the back of the flat 
she's putting it away 
but we have to move eventually and 
we should do it when she's safest 
when the vacuum stops we give her eight 
seconds to get to the back of the flat 
she's fast when she's 
cleaning then we move 
what's the trigger response time 
once we're mobile how 
long before detonation 
we have a maximum of three 
seconds to vacate the blast radius 
john and i will take the 
windows you take the stairs 
speed differential won't be 
as critical as the distance 
yes agreed 
she's further away 
she's moving to the back 
i estimate we have a minute left 
john has a daughter he 
may wish to say goodbye 
i'm sorry dr watson any movement will 
set off the grenade i hope you understand 
oscar wilde 
what 
he said "the truth is 
rarely pure and never simple" 
it's from the importance of being 
earnest we did it at school 
so did we now i recall 
i was lady bracknell 
yeah you were great 
well that's good to know 
i've always wondered 
good luck boys 
three two one go 
issued by the met office 
coastguard agency at 0505 
go on son get it up 
better out than in 
is it always like this 
usually it's much worse 
i might go and work in a bank 
is that an helicopter 
no not in this weather 
i never heard that one before 
sherrinford 
forget you ever heard it 
what 
sometimes when we're out in 
these waters we get that message 
just forget about it 
the detective 
the pirate 
golf whiskey x-ray this 
is a restricted area 
repeat restricted area 
you are off course 
are you receiving 
golf whiskey x-ray you are 
off course are you receiving 
this is a distress call 
we're in trouble here' 
golf whiskey x-ray 
what is your situation 
golf whiskey x-ray 
where are you now 
rocks we're going to hit' 
governor to the control room 
lockdown in progress 
designated red stations 
designated red stations' 
in the sand in the sand 
i need to speak to mycroft 
he's in hospital 
there was an explosion 
put me through to the hospital 
he's not conscious 
he's severely injured 
no-one is even confident 
he's going to pull through 
where's his brother 
where's sherlock holmes 
missing 
no he's not he's here 
sir we found two more from the boat 
another fella with guns' 
this is a mistake 
i'm the victim here this man 
stole my boat he's a pirate 
i don't even know who he is 
he's dr john watson formerly of 
the fifth northumberland fusiliers 
it's not a hospital 
i want eyes on eurus holmes 
go straight to the special unit 
deploy green and yellow 
shift on my authority 
sir 
i'm sparing your blushes because 
we're supposed to be on the same side 
and frankly this is embarrassing 
ooh doing a cavity search 
the true art of disguise 
according to your famous friend 
is not being looked at 
but i am looking at 
you aren't i mr holmes 
yes you are 
but that is sort of the point isn't it 
you see you should have been looking 
at the guy you just gave your pass to 
ah 
that's the trouble with 
uniforms and name badges 
people stop looking at faces 
we'd be better off with clown outfits 
at least they'd be satirically relevant 
oh you'll find the real landers on the 
north shore tied up with two others 
we had to find the right waistband 
this is insane this is unnecessary 
no your security is compromised 
and we don't know who to trust 
and that justifies dressing up 
yes it does 
it justifies dressing up or 
any damn thing i say it does 
now listen to me for your own 
physical safety do not speak 
do not indulge in any non-verbal signals 
suggestive of internal thought 
if the safety of my 
sister is compromised 
if the security of my 
sister is compromised 
if the incarceration of 
my sister is compromised 
in short if i find any indication my 
sister has left this island at any time 
i swear to you you will not 
he talked me out of lady bracknell 
this could have been very different 
are you in 
just arriving at the secure unit 
explain 
prison within a prison 
eurus must be allowed the strict 
minimum of human interaction 
meet her you're about to find out 
eyes on eurus holmes 
governor's orders 
answer yes or no 
has there ever been against 
my express instructions 
any attempt at a psychiatric 
evaluation of eurus holmes 
back it used to be yours 
you haven't been down 
here before have you 
silence of the lambs basically 
stay at least three feet away 
from the glass and all that 
why the headphones 
she doesn't stop playing 
sometimes for weeks 
beautiful 
an emotional significance 
survival strategy of the pack animal 
invest divinity in utility 
evil isn't really wrong 
are a prisoner of your own meat 
my hairband did you 
bring it like i asked 
i'm not one of the 
i-i don't work here 
my special hairband 
i'm not one of your doctors 
the one i made you steal from mummy 
it was the last thing 
i said to you remember 
the day they took me away 
no 
you came round to my 
flat a few weeks back 
you pretended to be a woman 
called faith smith we had chips 
does this mean you 
didn't bring my hairband 
how did you manage to get out of 
this place how did you do that 
easy look at me 
i am looking at you 
you can't see it can you 
you try and try but you just 
can't see you can't look 
see what 
oh the music 
i never know if it's beautiful 
or not only if it's right 
often they're the same thing 
if they're not always 
the same thing what's 
the point in beauty 
look at the violin 
i need to know how you escaped 
look at the violin 
how did you know 
how did i know 
i taught you don't you remember 
how can you not remember that 
eurus i don't remember you at all 
interesting 
mycroft told me you'd 
rewritten your memories 
he didn't tell me you'd 
written me out completely 
what do you mean rewritten 
you still don't know 
about redbeard do you 
oh this is going to be 
such a good day 
when you come home' 
everyone we sent in there 
it's hard to describe 
enslaved them 
she's been capable of 
that since she was five 
she's an adult now 
i warned you i ordered you 
she's clinically unique 
we had to try 
at what cost 
sadness is a poem' 
what cost 
tell me the worst 
thing that has happened 
she kept suggesting to dr taylor 
that he should kill his family 
couldn't get her out of his head 
and 
his family 
how you got out of here 
you know already look 
at me look and play 
no not bach you clearly 
don't understand it play you 
oh have you had sex 
why do you ask 
the music i've had sex 
how 
one of the nurses got careless 
i liked it 
messy though 
people are so breakable 
i take it he didn't consent 
afraid i didn't notice 
in the heat of the moment 
and afterwards well 
you couldn't really tell 
is that vibrato or 
is your hand shaking 
i warned you explicitly 
no-one was to talk to her alone 
you even brought her a 
visitor on christmas day 
i took a calculated risk 
you gave her a christmas present 
remember her christmas present 
i am aware of the dangers eurus poses 
and equipped to deal with them 
what dangers 
eurus doesn't just talk to 
people she reprograms them 
anyone who spends time with her 
is automatically compromised 
you we can help each other 
way you can help yourself 
so clearly you remember me 
i remember everything 
every single thing 
you just need a big enough hard drive 
let's continue 
did they tell you to keep 
three feet from the glass 
tell me what you remember 
you me and mycroft 
mycroft was quite clever he could 
understand things if you went a bit slow 
but you you were my favourite 
why was i your favourite 
because i could make you laugh 
i loved it when you laughed 
once i made you laugh all night 
i thought you were going to burst 
i was so happy 
then mummy and daddy had 
to stop me of course 
apparently you were screaming 
why was i screaming 
redbeard 
tell me what i don't know 
touch the glass 
i put my trust in 
you my implicit trust 
as governor of this institute 
it's obvious when it all started 
well she was never the 
same after that christmas 
it's as if you woke her up 
that is entirely beside the point 
i want to meet her 
redbeard was my dog 
i know what happened to redbeard 
oh sherlock you know nothing 
touch the glass and 
i'll tell you the truth 
i'll touch it too if you're scared 
i'll give you her straight back 
is not it's not right' 
everyone who went in there got affected 
one question that's 
your voice isn't it 
saying these things' 
if eurus has enslaved you then who 
exactly is in charge of this prison 
i'm sorry 
no 
you think it's a trick 
you look so unsure 
you're not used to 
being unsure are you 
it's more common than you'd think 
look at you 
the man who sees through everything 
is exactly the man who doesn't notice 
do you see how it was done 
i know you like explanations 
the signs you suspended the signs 
and my voice throat mic 
puts me through the speakers 
don't you think it's clever 
well you do keep asking 
me how i got out of here 
like this 
get in here all of you 
stop me killing him 
no no stop me in a minute 
hats and darth vader 
here now i'm here now 
big g means governor street speak 
i'm a bit down with the kids you know 
i'm relatable that way 
do you like my boys 
this one's got more stamina but 
he's less caring in the afterglow 
this way please 
smell all that insane criminality 
do you have cannibals here 
people leave their bodies to science 
i think cannibals would 
be so much more grateful 
ah isn't that sweet 
won't you sit down 
i wrote my own version of the 
nativity when i was a child 
the hungry donkey 
it was a bit gory but if you're 
going to put a baby in a manger 
you're asking for trouble 
you know what this 
place is of course 
of course 
so am i under arrest again 
you remain a person of interest 
but until you commit a verifiable crime 
you are i regret at liberty 
ah how do you want me 
there is in this facility 
a prisoner whose intellectual abilities 
are of occasional use to 
the british government 
what for like really difficult sums 
long division that sort of thing 
she predicted the exact dates of 
the last three terrorist attacks 
on the british mainland 
after an hour on twitter 
that sort of thing 
in return however 
she requires treats 
last year it was a violin 
this year 
five minutes unsupervised 
conversation with you 
me 
with me 
she has noted your interest in the 
activities of my little brother 
so what has she got to 
do with sherlock holmes 
whatever you're about to tell me 
going to be awesome 
i'm your christmas present 
so what's mine 
redbeard 
how are you 
is this an occasion for banter 
case in point 
eurus is in control 
help me please i'm on a 
plane and everyone's asleep 
help me 
very old friends of mine' 
hello i can hear you talking 
plane and it's going to crash' 
oh hello um 
try try to stay calm 
just tell me tell 
me what your name is 
i'm not supposed to tell 
my name to strangers 
of course not very good 
but um i'll tell you mine 
my name is 
hello 
oh dear we seem to 
have lost the connection 
how have you done this 
how is any of this possible 
you put me in here mycroft 
you brought me my treats 
what treats 
how can that be moriarty 
oh he recorded lots of little 
messages for me before he died 
loved it did you know his 
brother was a stationmaster 
i think he was always jealous 
the girl where is she 
can i talk to her again 
poor little thing 
alone in the sky in a great 
big plane with nowhere to land 
but where in the world is she 
it's a clever little puzzle 
if you want to apply yourself 
to it i can reconnect you 
but first 
that's my wife 
that's my wife 
oh god that's my wife 
i'm going to shoot 
the governor's wife 
please no 
please help her 
in about a minute bang dead 
you want to save 
the governor's wife 
choose either dr watson or 
mycroft to kill the governor 
oh oh god 
you can't do it sherlock if you do it 
it won't count i'll kill her anyway 
it has to be your 
brother or your friend 
you have to do this 
eurus will kill her 
it doesn't appear we have a choice 
right then countdown's starting 
how long 
no no no the countdown is for me 
withholding the precise deadline will 
apply the emotional pressure more evenly 
where possible please give me an explicit 
verbal indication of your anxiety levels 
i can't always read 
them from your behaviour 
i can't do this 
i can't it's murder 
this is not murder 
this is saving my wife 
i'm particularly focused 
on internal conflicts 
where strategising around a 
largely-intuitive moral code 
appears to create a 
counterintuitive result 
i will not kill 
i will not have blood on my hands 
yes very good thank you 
killing my wife is what you are doing 
no 
ok fine 
john 
dr watson are you married 
i was 
what would you give to get her back 
i mean if you could 
if it was possible 
what would you do to save her 
eurus will kill me 
please save my wife 
there will i'm afraid 
be regular prompts 
to create an atmosphere of urgency 
tick-tock tick-tock 
tick-tock tick-tock tick-tock' 
what's your name 
david 
and you're sure about this david 
of course i'm bloody sure 
nearly there 
right do you want to pray or anything 
with eurus holmes in the world 
who the hell would i pray to 
you are a good man and 
you are doing a good thing 
so are you 
i'll spend the rest of my 
life telling myself that 
please 
oh god 
i know that you're scared but 
you should also be very proud 
just do it be quick 
this is very good dr watson 
i should have fitted 
you with a cardiograph 
goodbye david 
tick-tick-tick' 
please 
i can't i'm sorry i can't do it 
i know it's all right 
stop no no stop 
i'm sorry 
remember me 
no 
are you all right 
interesting 
all right there you go you got 
what you wanted and he's dead 
dead or alive he really 
wasn't very interesting 
but you three you three were wonderful 
thank you 
you see what you did dr watson 
specifically because of your moral code 
because you don't want 
blood on your hands 
two people are dead instead of one 
two people 
yes sorry 
hang on 
what advantage did your 
moral code grant you 
is it not in the end selfish 
to keep one's hands clean 
at the expense of another's life 
you didn't have to kill her 
huh the condition of her survival 
was that you or mycroft 
had to kill her husband 
this is an experiment 
there will be rigour 
sherlock pick up the 
gun it's your turn next 
when i tell you to use it and i will 
remember what happened this time 
what if i don't want a gun 
oh the gun is intended as a mercy 
would you really want to 
do it with your bare hands 
it would waste valuable time 
probably just take it 
there's only one bullet left 
you will only need one 
but you will need it 
please go through 
there's a few tasks for you 
and a girl on a plane is 
getting very very scared 
treats 
yes you know a violin 
in exchange for 
she's very clever 
i'm beginning to think you're not 
someone's been redecorating 
we have more to worry about 
than her choice of colour scheme 
barely dry recent 
and it's for our benefit 
as a motivator to your 
continued cooperation 
i'm now reconnecting you 
going to be a bumpy night' 
yes hello 
hello we're still 
here can you hear us 
tell me where you are 
lots of people on it 
lots and lots but they're all 
asleep i can't wake them up 
no i understand but 
where did you come from 
enough for now 
time to play a new game 
look on the table in front 
of you open the envelope 
if you want to speak to the girl again 
earn yourself some phone time 
this is inhuman this is insane 
mycroft we know 
six months ago a man 
called evans was murdered 
unsolved except by me 
he was shot from a distance 
of 300 metres with this rifle 
now if the police had any brains 
they'd realise there are 
three suspects all brothers 
nathan garrideb alex 
garrideb and howard garrideb 
all these photos are up to date 
but which one pulled 
the trigger sherlock 
which one 
what's this we're supposed 
to solve this based on what 
this this is all we get 
please make use of 
your friends sherlock 
i want to see you interact with 
people that you're close to 
also you may have to 
choose which one to keep 
what do you make of it am i 
being asked to prove my usefulness 
yes i should think you are 
i will not be manipulated like this 
fine john john 
yeah i think i've seen one 
of these it's a buffalo gun 
i'd say 1940s old-fashioned 
sight no crosshairs 
glasses glasses nathan wears glasses 
evans was shot from 300 metres 
the kickback from a 
gun with this calibre 
no cuts no scarring 
it's not nathan then who's next 
well done dr watson 
how useful you are 
do you have a suspicion 
we're being made to compete 
we're not competing there's a plane 
in the air that's going to crash 
so what we're doing is 
trying to save a little girl 
today we have to be 
soldiers mycroft soldiers 
and that means to hell 
with what happens to us 
your priorities do you credit 
no my priorities just 
got a woman killed 
now as i understand it sherlock 
you try to repress your emotions 
to refine your reasoning 
i'd like to see how that 
works so if you don't mind 
i'm going to apply some 
context to your deductions 
oh dear god 
two of the garridebs 
work here as orderlies 
so getting the third along 
really wasn't too difficult 
once you bring in your verdict let 
me know and justice will be done 
early release 
you'll drop them into the sea 
sink or swim 
they're tied up 
exactly now there is context 
please continue with your deductions 
i'm now focusing on the 
difference to your mental capacity 
a specified consequence can make 
why should we bother 
what if we're disinclined to 
play your games little sister 
hm-hm i have if you remember 
provided you with some motivation 
the clouds like cotton wool' 
oh that's nice try to 
tell me more about the plane 
why won't my mummy wake up 
so it's got to be one of 
the other two now howard 
howard's a lifelong 
drunk pallor of his skin 
terminal gin blossoms on his red nose 
and terror notwithstanding 
a bad case of the dts 
there's no way he could have taken 
that shot from 300 metres way 
so that leaves us with alex 
indentations on the temples 
suggest he habitually wears glasses 
frown lines suggest 
a lifetime of peering 
he's short-sighted or he was 
his recent laser surgery 
has done the trick 
clothes he's made an effort 
suddenly he sees himself 
in quite a different 
light now that he's 
dumped the specs 
he even has a spray tan 
but he's clearly not used to 
his new personal grooming ritual 
that can be told by the state 
of his fingernails and 
the fact that there's 
hair growing in his ears 
so it's a superficial job then 
but he got his eyes fixed 
his hands were steady 
he pulled the trigger 
he killed evans 
are you ready to condemn the prisoner 
sherlock we can't do this 
the plane remember 
sherlock are you ready 
alex 
say it condemn him 
condemn him in the knowledge of 
what will happen to the man you name 
i condemn alex garrideb 
congratulations you got the right one 
now go through the door 
you dropped the other two why 
does it really make a difference 
killing the innocent 
instead of the guilty 
let's see 
no that felt pretty much the same 
john 
don't let her distract you 
one more minute on the phone 
i'm really frightened' 
it's ok don't worry 
i don't have very long with you 
so i just need you tell me what 
you can see outside the plane 
just the sea i can see the sea 
she's about to fly over a 
city in a pilotless plane 
we'll have to talk her through it 
are you still there' 
still here just give us a minute 
getting the plane away from any 
mainland any populated areas 
well obviously dr watson she's 
the one who's going to crash it 
no we could help her land it 
and if we fail and she 
crashes into a city 
how many will die then 
how are we going to get her to do that 
i'm afraid we're going 
to have to give her hope 
is there really no-one 
there that can help you 
have you really really checked 
everyone's asleep 
will you help me 
we're going to do 
everything that we can 
it's all right i 
now back to the 
matter in hand coffin 
problem someone is about to die 
it will be as i 
understand it a tragedy 
so many days not lived 
so many words unsaid et cetera 
et cetera et cetera et cetera 
yes yes yes and this i 
presume will be their coffin 
whose coffin sherlock 
please start your deductions 
i will apply some context in a moment 
well allowing for the entirely 
pointless courtesy of headroom 
i'd say this coffin is intended 
for someone of about five foot four 
a child's would be more expensive 
this is in the lower price range 
although still best 
available in that bracket 
that was a lonely night on google 
this is a practical 
and informed choice 
the balance of probability suggests 
that this is for an unmarried woman 
distant from her close relatives 
that is suggested by the economy of choice 
acquainted with the process of death 
but unsentimental about the necessity 
of disposal the lining of the coffin 
yes very good sherlock or we could 
just look at the name on the lid 
only it isn't a name 
so it's for somebody who loves somebody 
it's for somebody who loves sherlock 
this is all about you 
everything here 
so who loves you 
i'm assuming it's not a long list 
irene adler don't be ridiculous 
look at the coffin 
unmarried practical about death alone 
she's perfectly safe for the moment 
her flat is rigged to explode 
in approximately three minutes 
unless i hear the release 
code from her lips 
i'm calling her on your phone sherlock 
obvious surely 
oh one important restriction 
you're not allowed to mention 
in any way at all that 
her life is in danger 
you may not at any point suggest 
that there is any form of crisis 
if you do i will end 
this session and her life 
are we clear 
tick-tock tick-tock 
but why isn't she answering her phone 
you never answer your phone 
yes but it's me calling 
at the dead centre of town 
ok ok just one more time 
go on molly pick up 
just bloody pick up 
because i'm not having a good day' 
molly i just want you to do something 
very easy for me and not ask why 
oh god is this one 
of your stupid games 
no it's not a game 
i need you to help me 
well quickly then 
sherlock what is it 
what do you want 
molly please without asking 
why just say these words 
what words 
i love you 
no don't hang up do not hang up 
calmly sherlock or i will 
finish her right now 
why are you doing this to me 
why are you making fun of me 
please i swear you just 
have to listen to me 
softer sherlock 
molly this is for a case 
it's it's a sort of experiment 
i'm not an experiment sherlock 
no i know you're not an 
experiment you're my friend 
we're friends but please 
just say those words for me 
please don't do this 
just just don't do it 
it's very important 
i can't say why 
but i promise you it is 
i can't say that i can't 
i can't say that to you 
of course you can 
why can't you 
no i don't know why 
of course you do 
tick-tock tick-tock 
please just say it 
why 
because because it's true 
because it's true sherlock 
it's always been true 
well if it's true 
just say it anyway 
you bastard 
you say it first' 
final 30 seconds 
i 
i love you 
molly 
molly please 
i love you 
sherlock however hard that was 
eurus i won i won 
come on play fair the girl on 
the plane i need to talk to her 
i won i saved molly hooper 
huh 
saved her from what 
oh do be sensible there were 
no explosives in her little house 
why would i be so clumsy 
you didn't win you lost 
look what you did to her 
look what you did to yourself 
all those complicated little 
emotions i lost count 
emotional context sherlock 
it destroys you every time 
now please pull yourself together 
i need you at peak efficiency 
the next one isn't going to be so easy 
in your own time 
no no no 
no no no 
i know this is difficult and 
i know you're being tortured 
but you have got to keep it together 
this isn't torture this is vivisection 
we're experiencing science from 
the perspective of lab rats 
huh 
hey sis don't mean to 
complain but this one's empty 
what happened did you run out of ideas 
it's not empty sherlock you've 
still got the gun haven't you 
i told you you'd need it because 
only two can play the next game 
just two of you go on from here 
your choice it's make-your-mind-up time 
whose help do you need 
the most john or mycroft 
it's an elimination round 
you choose one and kill the other 
you have to choose family or friend 
mycroft or john watson 
remember there's a plane in the 
sky and it's not going to land 
we're not actually going 
to discuss this are we 
i'm sorry dr watson you're 
a fine man in many respects 
make your goodbyes and shoot him 
shoot dr watson 
there's no question who has to 
continue from here it's us you and me 
whatever lies ahead requires 
brainpower sherlock 
not sentiment 
don't prolong his agony shoot him 
do i get a say in this 
today we are soldiers 
soldiers die for their country 
i regret dr watson that 
privilege is now yours 
shit he's right 
he is in fact right 
make it swift no need 
to prolong his agony 
get it over with 
and we can get to work 
oh god i should have expected this 
pathetic you always were 
the slow one the idiot 
that's why i've always despised you 
you shame us all you 
shame the family name 
now for once in your 
life do the right thing 
put this stupid little 
man out of all our misery 
shoot him 
nothing more than a distraction 
a little scrap of ordinariness 
for you to impress to 
dazzle with your cleverness 
you'll find another 
because on balance even your 
lady bracknell was more convincing 
ignore everything he just 
said he's being kind 
he's trying to make it 
easy for me to kill him 
which is why this is 
going to be so much harder 
you said you liked my lady bracknell 
sherlock don't 
it's not your decision dr watson 
not in the face though please 
i promised my brain 
to the royal society 
where would you suggest 
well i suppose there is a 
heart somewhere inside me 
i don't imagine it's much of a target 
but why don't we try for that 
i won't allow this 
this is my fault moriarty 
five minutes' conversation with 
jim moriarty five years ago 
what did they discuss 
five minutes' conversation 
goodbye brother mine 
no flowers 
my request 
jim moriarty thought you'd make 
this choice he was so excited 
the end of the line 
five minutes 
it took her just five minutes 
to do all of this to us 
well not on my watch 
what are you doing 
a moment ago a brave man 
asked to be remembered 
i'm remembering the governor 
know about redbeard yet 
sherlock stop that at once 
yes yeah no i'm 
i'm still here i'm here 
you went away you said you'd 
help me and you went away 
yes i know 
well i'm sorry about that 
we we we must 
have got cut off um 
how how how long was i away 
hours hours and hours 
why don't grown-ups tell the truth 
no i-i am telling the truth 
you can trust me 
i'm not completely sure 
um now i tell you what 
you you've got to be 
really really brave for me 
can you go to the front of 
the plane can you do that 
ok i'm going 
where are you 
i don't know i've just woken up 
where are you 
i'm in another cell i just spoke 
to the girl on the plane again 
yes the plane will keep flying 
until it runs out of fuel 
is mycroft with you 
i have no idea i can 
hardly see anything 
mycroft mycroft 
keep exploring tell me anything 
you can about where you are 
the walls are rough 
they're rock i guess 
what are you standing on 
er stone i think but listen 
there's about two feet of water 
chains 
yeah my feet are chained up 
i can feel something 
bones sherlock 
there are bones in here 
what kind of bones 
er i don't know small 
oh hello are you at the 
front of the plane now 
yeah i still can't wake the driver up 
that's all right 
what can you see now 
i can see a river 
well you and i are going to 
have to drive this plane together 
just you and me 
we just need to get in touch 
with some people on the ground 
now um can you see anything 
that looks like a radio 
no 
that's all right but keep 
looking we've got plenty of time 
it's just turbulence it's 
nothing to worry about 
my ears hurt

i just spoke to your brother 
how is he he's a bit 
shaken up that's all 
she didn't hurt him she just 
locked him in her old cell 
what goes around comes around 
give me a moment boys 
um mycroft make 
sure he's looked after 
he's not as strong as he thinks he is 
the helicopter ready 
let's move her then 
is that him sir sherlock holmes 
fan are you 
well he's a great man sir 
no he's better than that 
he's a good one 
i can't can i 
well you gave her what she 
was looking for context 
is that good 
it's not good it's not bad it's 
it is what it is 
alive for all these years 
how is that even possible 
what uncle rudi began i 
thought it best to continue 
i'm not asking how you did it 
idiot boy i'm asking how could you 
kind 
you told us that our daughter was dead 
better that than tell 
you what she had become 
i'm sorry 
whatever she became 
whatever she is now mycroft 
she remains our daughter 
and my sister 
then you should have done better 
he did his best 
then he's very limited 
where is she 
back in sherrinford 
secure this time 
people have died 
without doubt she will kill 
again if she has the opportunity 
there's no possibility 
she'll ever be able to leave 
when can we see her 
there's no point 
how dare you say that 
she won't talk 
she won't communicate 
with anyone in any way 
she has passed beyond our view 
there are no words 
that can reach her now 
sherlock 
well you were always the grown-up 
what do we do now 
er yeah i-i think 
you'd better get round here 
ps i know you two 
and if i'm gone i know 
what you could become 
because i know who you really are 
a junky who solves crimes to get high 
and the doctor who never 
came home from the war 
will you listen to me who you 
really are it doesn't matter 
it's all about the legend 
the stories the adventures 
there is a last refuge 
for the desperate 
the unloved the persecuted 
there is a final court 
of appeal for everyone 
when life gets too strange 
too impossible too frightening 
there is always one last hope 
when all else fails 
there are two men sitting 
arguing in a scruffy flat 
like they've always been 
there and they always will 
the best and wisest 
men i have ever known 
my baker street boys 
sherlock holmes and dr watson 
running and panting 
a man yells 
yelling and growling 
growling 
the man cries in pain 
oh hello 
are you all right 
what is it dear are you lost 
growling 
he screams

racing out of control 
a rocket tearing itself to pieces 
trapped on the launch pad 
i need a case 
you've just solved one by harpooning 
a dead pig apparently 
oh that was this morning 
when's the next one 
nothing on the website 
i can't find bluebell anywhere 
please can you help" 
bluebell a rabbit john oh 
ah but there's more 
before bluebell disappeared 
it turned luminous 
kirsty then the next morning 
bluebell was gone 
hutch still locked 
no sign of a forced entry 
what am i saying this is brilliant 
phone lestrade 
tell him there's an escaped rabbit 
are you serious it's this or cluedo 
ah no 
we are never playing that again 
why not it's not possible 
for the victim to have done it 
it was the only possible solution 
it's not in the rules 
well then the rules are wrong 
doorbell rings 
a single ring 
maximum pressure 
just under the half second 
both: client 
tv: dartmoor it's always been 
a place of myth and legend 
but is there something else 
lurking out here 
something very real 
dartmoor is also home 
to one the government's 
most secret of operations 
the chemical and biological weapons 
research centre 
which is said to be even more 
sensitive than porton down 
since the end of 
the second world war 
there have been persistent stories 
about the baskerville experiments 
genetic mutations 
animals grown for the battlefield 
there are many who believe 
that within this compound in 
the heart of this ancient wildness 
there are horrors beyond imagining 
but the real question is 
are all of them still inside' 
i was just a kid 
it was on the moor 
it was dark but i know what i saw 
i know what killed my father 
what did you see 
oh i was just about to say 
yes in a tv interview 
i prefer to do my own editing 
yes sorry yes of course 
excuse me 
blows his nose 
in your own time 
but quite quickly 
do you know dartmoor mr holmes no 
it's an amazing place 
it's like nowhere else 
it's sort of bleak but beautiful 
hm not interested moving on 
we used to go for walks 
after my mum died my dad and me 
every evening 
we'd go out onto the moor 
good skipping to the night 
that your dad was violently killed 
where did that happen 
there's a place 
it's a sort of local landmark 
called dewer's hollow 
that's an ancient name 
for the devil 
so 
did you see the devil that night 
yes 
he cries out 
it was huge 
coal-black fur with red eyes 
it growls 
it got him 
tore at him tore him apart 
i can't remember anything else 
they found me the next morning 
just wandering on the moor 
my dad's body was never found 
hm 
red eyes coal-black fur 
enormous 
a dog wolf 
or a genetic experiment 
are you laughing at me mr holmes 
why are you joking 
my dad was always going on about 
the things they were doing 
at baskerville 
about the type of monsters 
they were breeding there 
people used to laugh at him 
at least the tv people 
took me seriously 
and i assume did wonders 
for devon tourism yeah 
henry whatever did happen 
to your father it was 20 years ago 
why come to us now 
not sure you can help me mr holmes 
since you find it all so funny 
because of what happened last night 
why what happened last night 
how how do you know 
i didn't know i noticed 
you came up from devon 
on the first train this morning 
you had a disappointing breakfast 
and a black coffee the girl 
across the aisle fancied you 
though initially keen 
you've changed your mind 
you are anxious to have 
your first cigarette of the day 
sit down mr knight and do 
please smoke i'd be delighted 
how on earth did you notice 
all that it's not important 
punched out holes where your 
ticket's been checked not now 
i've been cooped-up for ages 
you're showing off i am a show-off 
that's what we do 
train napkin you used to mop up 
the spilled coffee 
strength of the stain shows 
that you didn't take milk 
there are traces of ketchup on it 
and on your lips and sleeve 
cooked breakfast or the nearest 
thing those trains manage sandwich 
how did you know 
it was disappointing 
is there any other type of breakfast 
on a train the girl 
female handwriting's distinctive 
wrote her number on the napkin 
i can tell from the angle she wrote 
at that she was sat across from you 
after she got off i imagine 
you used the napkin to mop up 
your spilled coffee 
accidentally smudging the numbers 
you've been over the last 
four digits in another pen 
so you wanted to keep the number 
you used the napkin to blow your 
nose so you're not that into her 
then there's the nicotine stains 
on your shaking fingers 
i know the signs 
no chance to smoke when 
on the train no time to roll one 
before you got a cab here 
it's just after 915 
you're desperate 
the first train from exeter 
to london leaves at 546am 
you got the first one so something 
important must have happened 
last night am i wrong 
no 
you're right 
you're completely exactly right 
bloody hell i heard you were quick 
it's my job now shut up and smoke 
ahem 
henry your parents both died 
and you were what seven years old 
i know that 
he inhales the smoke 
that must be quite a trauma 
now have you ever thought that maybe 
you invented this story this 
he inhales loudly 
that's what dr mortimer says 
who his therapist my therapist 
obviously 
louise mortimer 
she's the reason 
i came back to dartmoor 
she thinks i have to face my demons 
what happened when you went back 
to dewer's hollow last night 
you went there on the advice of your 
therapist and now you're consulting 
a detective 
what did you see that changed 
everything it's a strange place 
the hollow 
it makes you feel 
so cold inside so afraid 
yes if i wanted poetry i'd read 
john's emails to his girlfriends 
much funnier what did you see 
he sighs 
footprints 
on the exact spot 
where i saw my father torn apart 
man's or a woman's 
neither they were 
is that it nothing else 
footprints is that all 
yes but they were 
dr mortimer wins 
it's a childhood trauma 
masked by an invented memory 
boring goodbye mr knight 
thank you for smoking 
what about the footprints 
oh they're probably paw prints 
could be anything 
therefore nothing 
off to devon with you 
and have a cream tea on me 
mr holmes they were 
the footprints of a gigantic hound 
say that again 
i found footprints they were big 
no no no your exact words 
repeat your exact words 
from a moment ago 
exactly as you said them 
mr holmes 
they were 
the footprints of a gigantic hound 
i'll take the case sorry what 
thank you for bringing this to 
my attention it's very promising 
sorry what 
a minute ago footprints were boring 
now they're very promising 
it's got nothing to do with 
footprints you weren't listening 
baskerville heard of it 
vaguely it's very hush-hush 
sounds like a good place to start 
you'll come down 
i can't leave london 
at the moment far too busy 
but don't worry 
i'm putting my best man onto it 
i can always rely on john 
to send me the relevant data as 
he never understands a word of it 
what are you talking about 
you don't have a case you were 
complaining i've got bluebell 
the case of the vanishing 
glow-in-the-dark rabbit nato's in 
uproar oh you're not coming then 
oh 
ok 
ok 
i don't need those any more 
i'm going to dartmoor 
you go on ahead henry we'll follow 
later sorry so you are coming 
a monstrous hound 
i wouldn't miss this for the world 
shouting 
no intention of taking me on a boat 
bang 
oh looks like mrs hudson 
finally got to the wife in doncaster 
hm wait until she finds out 
about the one in islamabad 
paddington station please 
there's baskerville 
er that's grimpen village 
so that must be 
yes dewer's hollow 
what's that hm 
a mine field 
technically 
baskerville's an army base 
so i guess they've always been keen 
to keep people out 
clearly 
right three tours a day 
tell your friends tell anyone 
don't be strangers and remember 
stay away from the moor at night 
if you value your lives 
take care 
they laugh 
it's cold 
he growls 
he screams 
screaming 
he sighs 
that part doesn't change 
what does 
oh there's something else 
it's a word 
liberty 
liberty 
and there's another word 
in 
i n 
liberty in 
what do you think it means 
sorry we couldn't do 
a double room for you boys 
that's fine we're not 
there you go 
oh ta i'll just get your change 
ta 
there you go 
i couldn't help noticing on the map 
of the moor a skull and crossbones 
oh that 
pirates er no the great grimpen 
minefield they call it oh right 
it's not what you think 
it's the baskerville testing site 
it's been going for 80-odd years 
i'm not sure anyone really knows 
what's there any more hm 
explosives oh not just explosives 
break into that place and if 
you're lucky you just get blown up 
so they say 
in case you're planning 
a wee stroll ta i'll remember 
aye no it buggers up tourism 
a bit so thank god 
for the demon hound 
did you see that show the 
documentary quite recently yeah 
god bless henry knight 
and his monster from hell 
ever seen it the hound 
me no no 
fletcher has 
he runs the walks the monster walks 
for the tourists you know 
he's seen it 
that's handy for trade 
i'm just saying we've been 
rushed off our feet billy 
yeah lots of monster hunters 
it don't take much these days 
one mention on twitter and whoomph 
we're out of wkd 
oh right what with the monster 
and the ruddy prison 
i don't know how we sleep nights 
do you gary like a baby 
that's not true he's a snorer 
hey ssh 
is yours a snorer got any crisps 
yeah no all right right 
take care bye take care bye 
mind if i join you 
it's not true is it you haven't 
actually seen this hound thing 
are you from the papers no 
nothing like that just curious 
have you seen it maybe 
got any proof 
why would i tell you if i did 
excuse me 
i called henry bet's off john 
sorry what bet 
my plan needs darkness we've got 
another half an hour of light 
wait wait what bet 
oh i bet john here 50 quid that you 
couldn't prove you'd seen the hound 
yeah the guys in the pub 
said you could 
well you're going to lose 
your money mate yeah 
yeah i seen it 
only about a month ago up at 
the hollow it was foggy mind 
couldn't make much out 
i see no witnesses i suppose 
no but never are 
no wait there 
is that it it's not exactly proof 
is it sorry john i win 
wait wait that's not all people 
don't like going up there you know 
to the hollow 
gives them a bad sort of feeling 
ooh is it haunted 
is that supposed to convince me 
nah don't be stupid 
nothing like that 
but i reckon 
there is something out there 
something from baskerville escaped 
a clone a super-dog maybe 
god knows what they've been 
spraying on us all these years 
or putting in the water 
i wouldn't trust them 
as far as i could spit 
is that the best you've got 
i had a mate once 
who worked for the mod 
one weekend we were meant to go 
fishing but he never showed up 
well not till late 
when he did 
he was white as a sheet 
i can see him now 
fletcher" he said 
he'd been sent to some secret 
army place porton down maybe 
maybe baskerville 
or somewhere else 
in the labs there 
the really secret labs 
he said he'd seen terrible things 
rats as big as dogs he said 
and dogs dogs the size of horses 
um we did say 50 
ta 
pass please 
thank you 
you've got id for baskerville 
how 
it's not specific to this place 
it's my brother's 
access all areas i um ahem 
acquired it ages ago just in case 
brilliant what's the matter 
we'll get caught we won't 
well not yet 
caught in five minutes 
around your top secret weapons base" 
boiled" that's if we don't get shot 
clear thanks very much thank you 
straight through sir 
mycroft's name literally opens doors 
i've told you he practically is 
the british government 
i reckon we've got about 20 minutes 
before they realise 
something's wrong 
what is it are we in trouble 
are we in trouble sir 
yes sir sorry sir 
you were expecting us 
your id showed up straight away 
mr holmes corporal lyons security 
is there something wrong sir 
i hope not corporal i hope not 
we don't get inspected here 
ever heard of a spot check 
captain john watson 
fifth northumberland fusiliers sir 
major barrymore won't be pleased 
sir he'll want to see you both 
i'm afraid we won't have time 
we need the full tour 
right away carry on 
that's an order corporal yes sir 
nice touch 
haven't pulled rank in ages 
enjoy it oh yeah 
monkey screeches 
how many animals do you keep down 
here lots sir 
any ever escape they'd have to know 
how to use that lift sir 
we're not breeding them that clever 
unless they have help 
ah and you are it's all right 
dr frankland 
i'm just showing these gentlemen 
around ah new faces how nice 
careful you don't get stuck here 
though i only came to fix a tap 
how far down does that lift go 
quite a way sir 
hm-mm and what's down there 
well we have to keep 
the bins somewhere sir 
this way please gentlemen 
so what exactly is it that you do 
here 
i thought you'd know sir 
this being an inspection 
well i'm not an expert am i 
everything from stem cell research 
to trying to cure the common cold 
sir 
but mostly weaponry 
of one sort or another yes 
biological chemical one war ends 
another begins sir 
new enemies to fight 
we have to be prepared 
beeping 
monkey screeches 
ok michael 
let's try harlow 3 next time 
dr stapleton stapleton 
yes who's this 
priority ultra ma'am orders from 
on high an inspection really 
we are to be accorded 
every courtesy dr stapleton 
what's your role at baskerville 
she laughs 
accorded every courtesy 
isn't that the idea 
i'm not free to say 
official secrets 
oh you most certainly are free 
and i suggest you remain that way 
i have a lot of fingers 
in a lot of pies 
i like to mix things up 
genes mostly 
now and again actual fingers 
stapleton i knew i knew your name 
i doubt it 
people say there's no such thing 
as coincidence 
dull lives they must lead 
have you been talking 
to my daughter why did bluebell 
have to die dr stapleton 
the rabbit disappeared from inside 
a locked hutch which was always 
suggestive the rabbit 
clearly an inside job 
oh you reckon 
why because it glowed in the dark 
i have absolutely no idea what 
you're talking about who are you 
alarm sounds 
we've seen enough for now 
thank you so much that's it 
that's it it's this way isn't it 
just a minute 
did we just break into a military 
base to investigate a rabbit 
beeping 
mobile phone beeps 
ha 23 minutes 
mycroft's getting slow 
hello again 
er major 
this is bloody outrageous 
why wasn't i told 
major barrymore is it 
yes well good 
very good we're very impressed 
aren't we mr holmes 
hugely the point of baskerville was 
to eliminate bureaucratic nonsense 
sorry major inspections 
can't remain unmonitored for ever 
goodness knows what you'd get up to 
keep walking sir 
alarm sounds 
id unauthorised sir what 
i've just had the call 
is that right who are you 
look there's obviously been 
some kind of mistake 
clearly not mycroft holmes 
computer error 
it'll all have to go in the report 
what the hell's going on 
it's all right major 
i know who these gentlemen are 
you do yeah 
i'm getting a little slow on faces 
but mr holmes here isn't someone 
i expected to show up in this place 
oh well good to see you again 
mycroft 
i had the honour of meeting 
mr holmes at the who conference in 
brussels was it 
vienna vienna that's it 
this is mr mycroft holmes major 
there's obviously been a mistake 
on your head be it dr frankland 
i'll show them out corporal 
very well sir 
thank you 
this is about henry knight 
isn't it i thought so 
i knew he wanted help but i didn't 
realise he was going to contact 
sherlock holmes 
oh don't worry 
i know who you really are 
i'm never off your website 
i thought you'd be wearing the hat 
that wasn't my hat 
i hardly recognise him 
without the hat it wasn't my hat 
i love the blog too dr watson 
oh cheers 
the pink thing and that one about 
the aluminium crutch yes 
you know henry knight 
well i knew his dad better 
he had all sorts of mad theories 
about this place 
still he was a good friend 
listen i can't really talk now 
here's my cell number 
if i can help with henry 
give me a call 
i never did ask dr frankland 
what exactly is it that you do here 
ah mr holmes 
i would love to tell you 
but then of course 
i'd have to kill you 
that would be tremendously ambitious 
of you tell me about dr stapleton 
i never speak ill of a colleague 
but you'd speak well of one 
which you're clearly omitting to do 
i do seem to be don't i 
i'll be in touch any time 
so so 
what was all that about the rabbit 
oh please 
can we not do this this time 
do what you being all mysterious 
with yourcheekbones 
and turning your coat collar up 
so you look cool 
i don't do that yeah you do 
so the email from kirsty 
the missing luminous rabbit 
kirsty stapleton whose mother 
specialises in genetic manipulation 
she made her daughter's rabbit 
glow in the dark 
probably a fluorescent gene 
removed and spliced into the 
specimen simple enough these days 
so 
so we know that dr stapleton 
performs secret genetic experiments 
on animals 
the question is has she been 
working on something deadlier 
than a rabbit 
to be fair 
that is quite a wide field 
hi hi 
come in come in 
this is er 
are you um rich 
yeah right 
there's a couple of words 
it's what i keep seeing 
liberty 
liberty liberty and 
in 
it's just that 
have you finished hm 
mean anything to you 
liberty in death isn't that the 
expression the only true freedom 
what now then 
sherlock'sgot a plan yes 
right we take you back out 
onto the moor 
ok and see if 
anything attacks you what 
that should bring things to a head 
at night 
you want me to go out there 
at night hm that's your plan 
brilliant got any better ideas 
that's not a plan 
if there is a monster out there 
john there's only one thing to do 
find out where it lives 
rustling in the bushes 
he gasps 
met a friend of yours what 
dr frankland 
oh right bob yeah 
he seems pretty concerned about you 
oh he's a worrier bless him 
he's been very kind to me 
since i came back 
he knew your father yeah 
but he works at baskerville didn't 
your dad have a problem with that 
well mates are mates aren't 
they i mean look at you and john 
what about us 
well i mean he's a pretty 
straightforward bloke and you 
well they agreed never to talk 
about work uncle bob and my dad 
dewer's hollow 
metallic thud 
thudding continues 
thud 
thudding continues 
screeching 
howling in the distance 
howling gets louder 
growling 
snarling 
oh my god oh my god 
oh my god oh my god oh my god 
did you see it 
did you hear that we saw it 
we saw it 
no i didn't see anything 
what what are you talking about 
i didn't see anything 
look he must have seen it 
i saw it he must have 
he must have 
i why why 
why would he say that 
it was there it was 
henry henry i need you 
to sit down try and relax please 
i'm ok i feel ok 
i'm going to give you something 
to help you sleep all right 
this is good news john 
it'sit'sit's good 
i'm not crazy 
there is a hound there there is 
and sherlock he saw it too 
no matter what he says he saw it 
well he's in a pretty bad way 
he's manic 
totally convinced there's some 
mutant super-dog roaming the moors 
and there isn't though is there 
if people knew how to make 
a mutant super-dog we'd know 
it'd be for sale 
i mean that's how it works 
listen on the moor i saw 
someone signalling morse 
i guess it's morse 
it doesn't seem to make much sense 
he breathes deeply 
u m q r a 
does that mean anything 
so ok what have we got 
we know there's footprints 
because henry found them 
and so did the tour guide bloke 
we all heard something 
maybe we should just look for 
whoever's got a big dog 
henry's right what 
i saw it too 
what i saw it too john 
justjust a minute you saw what 
a hound out there in the hollow 
a gigantic hound 
um look sherlock 
we have to be rational about this 
ok now you 
of all people can't just 
let's just stick to what we know 
yes stick to the facts 
once you've ruled out 
the impossible whatever remains 
however improbable must be true 
what does that mean 
huh 
look at me 
i'm afraid john 
afraid 
sherlock 
i've always been able to 
keep myself distant 
divorce myself from feelings 
but look you see 
body's betraying me 
interesting yes emotions 
the grit on the lens 
the fly in the ointment 
yeah all right spock 
justtake it easy 
you've been pretty wired lately 
you know you have 
i think you've just gone out there 
and got yourself a bit worked up 
worked up 
it was dark and scary 
me there's nothing wrong with me 
hm 
sherlock 
sherl there is nothing wrong 
with me do you understand 
you want me to prove it yes 
we're looking for a dog yes 
a great big dog that's your 
brilliant theory cherchez le chien 
where shall we start 
how about them 
the sentimental widow and her son 
the unemployed fisherman 
the answer's yes yes she's got a 
west highland terrier called whisky 
not what we're looking for 
for god's sake 
look at his jumper hardly worn 
clearly he's uncomfortable 
could be the material 
or the hideous pattern 
suggests it's a present 
he wants into his mother's 
good books why probably money 
he's treating her to a meal 
but his own portion is small 
he wants to impress her but he's 
trying to economise on his own food 
maybe he's not hungry 
no small plate starter 
he's practically licked it clean 
she's nearly finished her pavlova 
if she'd treated him 
he'd have had as much as he wanted 
he's hungry and not well-off you 
can tell by his cuffs and shoes 
only a mother would give him 
a christmas present like that 
it could be an aunt or older 
sister but mother's more likely 
he was a fisherman the scarring 
on his hands is distinctive 
fish hooks 
they're old 
suggesting long-term unemployment 
not much industry here 
so he's turned to his widowed mother 
for help widowed 
she's got a man's wedding ring 
on a chain around her neck 
clearly her late husband's 
and too big for her finger 
she's well-dressed 
but her jewellery is cheap 
she could afford better 
but she's kept it sentimental 
the dog there are tiny hairs on her 
leg but none above the knees 
suggesting it's a small dog 
probably a terrier 
it is a west highland terrier called 
whisky "how do you know that" 
she was on the same train as us 
and i heard her call its name 
that's listening 
i use my senses unlike some people 
so you see i am fine 
in fact i've never been better 
so just leave me alone 
yeah ok 
ok 
why would you listen to me i'm just 
your friend i don't have friends 
no 
i wonder why 
he sighs 
screeching 
creaking 
moaning 
oh mr selden 
you've done it again 
i keep catching it with my belt 
oh god oh 
mobile phone beeps 
so 
oh you're a bad man 
snarling 
argh argh 
cocks trigger 
pants with fear 
he screams 
he pants and screams 
that's so mean 
um more wine doctor are you 
trying to get me drunk doctor 
the thought never occurred 
because a while ago i thought 
you were chatting me up 
oh where did i go wrong 
when you started asking about 
my patients well i am one 
of henry's oldest friends 
yeah and he's one of my 
patients so i can't talk about him 
although he has told me 
about all his oldest friends 
which one are you a new one 
ok what about his father 
he wasn't one of your patients 
wasn't he some sort of 
conspiracy nuttertheorist 
you're only a nutter if 
you're wrong hm and was he wrong 
i should think so but he got 
fixated on baskerville didn't he 
with what they were doing in there 
couldn't henry have gone the 
same way started imagining a hound 
why do you think 
i'll talk about this 
because i think you're worried about 
him and because i'm a doctor too 
and because i have another friend 
who might be having the same problem 
she sighs 
ah dr watson hi hello 
how's the investigation going 
er hello 
what investigation 
didn't you know don't you read 
the blog sherlock holmes 
it's sherlock who 
private detective this is his pa 
pa well live-in pa perfect 
live-in 
this is dr mortimer 
henry's therapist 
oh hello bob frankland 
listen tell sherlock i've been 
keeping an eye on stapleton 
any time he wants a little chat 
all right hm 
he laughs 
oh 
why don't you buy him a drink 
i think he likes you 
knocking 
morning 
oh how are you feeling 
i 
i didn't sleep very well 
oh that's a shame 
shall i make us some coffee 
oh look you've got damp 
listen last night 
why did you say 
you hadn't seen anything 
i mean i only saw the hound 
for a minute but hound 
what why do you call it a hound 
why a hound 
why what do you mean 
it's odd isn't it 
it's a strange choice of words 
archaic 
that's why i took the case 
of a gigantic hound" 
why say "hound" 
i don't know i've never 
actually i'd better skip 
the coffee 
birdsong 
did you get anywhere 
with that morse code 
nah 
u m q r a wasn't it umqra 
nothing umqra 
look forget it i thought 
i was onto something i wasn't 
sure yeah 
how about louise mortimer 
did you get anywhere with her no 
too bad 
but did you get any information 
you're being funny now 
thought it might break the ice 
a bit 
funny doesn't suit you 
let's stick to ice 
john it's fine 
wait something happened to me 
last night something 
i've not experienced before 
yes you said fear sherlock holmes 
got scared you said it was more 
than that john it was doubt 
i felt doubt 
i've always been able to trust 
my senses the evidence of 
my own eyes until last night 
you can't actually believe 
that you saw some kind of monster 
no i can't believe that 
but i did see it 
so the question is how how 
yes 
yeah right good 
so you've got something to 
go on then good luck with that 
listen what i said before john 
i meant it 
i don't have friends 
i've just got one 
right 
john 
john you are amazing 
you are fantastic 
yes all right 
you don't have to overdo it 
you may not be the most luminous of 
people but as a conductor of light 
you are unbeatable cheers() what 
some people who aren't geniuses 
have an ability to stimulate it 
in others you were saying sorry 
don't spoil it so what have i done 
that's so bloody stimulating 
yeah 
what if it's not a word 
what if it is individual letters 
you think it's an acronym 
absolutely no idea but 
what the hell are you doing here 
oh nice to see you too() 
i'm on holiday would you believe 
no i wouldn't 
hello john greg 
i heard you were in the area 
what are you up to 
are you after this hound of hell 
like on the telly 
i'm waiting for an explanation 
inspector why are you here 
i've told you i'm on holiday 
you're brown as a nut 
you're clearly just back from your 
holidays i fancied another one 
oh this is mycroft isn't it 
now look of course it is 
one mention of baskerville 
and he sends down my handler 
to spy on me incognito 
is that why you're calling 
yourself "greg" that's his name 
is it yes 
if you'd ever bothered to find out 
look i'm not your handler 
and i just don't do 
what your brother tells me 
actually you could be just the man 
we want why 
well i've not been idle sherlock 
i think i might have found something 
here 
i didn't know if it was relevant 
starting to look like it might be 
that is an awful lot of meat 
for a vegetarian restaurant 
excellent 
a nice scary inspector from 
scotland yard who can put in a 
few calls might come in very handy 
shop 
what's this 
coffee i made coffee 
you never make coffee 
don't you want it 
you don't have to keep apologising 
thanks 
hm i don't take sugar 
these records go back 
nearly two months 
that's nice it's good 
is that when you had the idea 
after the tv show went out 
it's me it was me 
i'm sorry gary i couldn't help it 
i had a bacon sandwich 
at cal's wedding and one thing 
led to another nice try 
look we were just trying to give 
things a bit of a boost you know 
let a great big dog run wild up 
on the moor it was heaven-sent 
it was like us 
having our own loch ness monster 
and where do you keep it there's 
an old mine shaft it's not too far 
he was all right there was 
we couldn't control 
the bloody thing it was vicious 
and then a month ago 
billy took him to the vet 
and you know 
he's dead 
put down 
yeah no choice 
so it's over 
it was just a joke you know 
yeah hilarious() 
you've nearly driven 
a man out of his mind 
you know he's actually pleased 
you're here secretly pleased 
is he 
that's nice 
i suppose he likes having 
all the same faces back together 
appeals to hishis 
asperger's 
so you believe them about having 
the dog destroyed no reason not to 
well hopefully 
there's no harm done 
i'm not quite sure what i'd charge 
them with anyway i'll have a word 
with the local force 
right that's that then 
catch you later 
i'm enjoying this it's nice 
to get london out of your lungs 
so that was their dog that people 
saw out on the moor looks like it 
but that wasn't what you saw 
that wasn't just an ordinary dog 
no it was immense 
it had burning red eyes 
and it was glowing john 
its whole body was glowing 
i've got a theory but i need to get 
back into baskerville to test it 
how can't pull off 
the id trick again 
might not have to 
hello brother dear how are you 
afternoon sir 
can you turn the engine off 
thank you 
i need to see major barrymore 
as soon as we get inside 
right which means you'll have to 
start the search for the hound ok 
in the labs 
stapleton's first 
it could be dangerous 
oh you know i'd love to() 
i'd love to give you unlimited 
access to this place why not 
it's a simple enough request major 
i've never heard of anything 
so bizarre 
you're to give me 24 hours 
it's what i negotiated 
not a second more 
i may have to comply with this 
order but i don't have to like it 
i don't know what the hell 
you expect to find here anyway 
perhaps the truth about what 
oh i see 
the big coat should have told me 
you're one of the conspiracy lot 
aren't you 
well then go ahead seek them out 
the monsters the death rays 
the aliens 
have you got any of those 
oh just wondering 
a couple 
crash landed here in the '60s 
we call them abbott and costello 
good luck mr holmes 
aargh oh god 
he cries out 
oh 
oh god 
ow 
loud alarms blare 
ooh 
alarm continues 
oh come on 
alarm stops 
hello 
monkey screams 
whirring 
no come on come on 
whirring 
he dials number 
oh damn it 
growling 
growling 
phone rings 
you've got to get me out 
the first lab that we saw) 
growling 
oh 
keep talking' 
but i can hear it now) 
growling 
can you see it 
growling 
i can see it 
are you all right john 
jesus christ it was the hound 
sherlock it was here i swear it 
sherlock it must it must 
did-did you see it you must have 
it's all right it's ok now 
no it's not it's not ok 
i saw it i was wrong 
hm well let's not jump 
to conclusions what 
what did you see i told you i saw 
the hound huge red eyes yes 
glowing yeah 
no what 
i made up the bit about glowing 
you saw what you expected to see 
because i told you 
you have been drugged 
we have all been drugged drugged 
can you walk 
of course i can walk come on then 
it's time to lay this ghost 
oh back again 
what's on your mind this time 
murder dr stapleton 
refined cold-blooded murder 
will you tell little kirsty what 
happened to bluebell or shall i 
ok what do you want 
can i borrow your microscope 
are you sure you're ok 
you look very peaky 
no i'm all right 
it was the gfp gene 
from a jellyfish 
in case you're interested what 
in the rabbits oh right yeah 
aequorea victoria 
if you really want to know 
why why not 
we don't ask questions like that 
here it isn't done 
it was a mix-up anyway 
my daughter ended up 
with one of the lab specimens 
so poor bluebell had to go 
your compassion is overwhelming 
i know 
i hate myself sometimes 
so come on then you can trust me 
i'm a doctor 
what else have you got 
hidden away up here 
she sighs 
listen if you can imagine it 
someone is probably doing it 
somewhere of course they are 
cloning yes of course 
dolly the sheep remember 
human cloning why not 
he clears his throat 
and what about animals not sheep 
big animals 
size isn't a problem not at all 
the only limits are ethics 
and the law and both those things 
can be very flexible 
but not here not at baskerville 
it's not there 
jesus nothing there 
it doesn't make any sense 
what were you expecting to find 
a drug of course 
it has to be a drug 
an hallucinogenic 
or a deliriant of some kind 
there's no trace of anything 
in the sugar sugar sugar yes 
a simple process of elimination 
i saw the hound saw it as my 
imagination expected me to see it 
a genetically engineered monster 
i knew i couldn't believe my eyes 
so there were 
seven possible reasons 
the most possible being narcotics 
henry knight he saw it too but 
you didn't john you didn't see it 
we have eaten and drunk the same 
things since we got to grimpen 
apart from one thing 
you don't take sugar in your coffee 
i see so 
i took it from henry's kitchen 
his sugar 
it's perfectly all right 
but maybe it's not a drug 
no it has to be a drug 
how did it get into our systems 
how 
there has to be something 
something 
something 
something buried deep 
get out what 
get out i need to go to 
my mind palace your what 
he's not going to be doing 
much talking for a while 
we may as well go 
his what oh his "mind palace" 
it's a memory technique 
a sort of mental map 
you plot a map with a location 
it doesn't have to be a real place 
you deposit memories there 
theoretically you never forget 
anything all you do is find your way 
back to it 
so this imaginary location could be 
anything a house or a street yeah 
but he said "palace" he said it was 
a palace yeah well he would 
wouldn't he 
bell tolls 
sound of marching band 
fades in and out 
dog barks and howls 
mechanised voice: hound 
dog howls 
animal snarls 
gunshot 
she screams and whimpers 
she whimpers 
oh my god 
oh my god oh my god i am so 
i am so sorry i am so sorry 
john yeah i'm on it 
project hound i must have 
read about it stored it away 
an experiment in 
a cia facility in liberty indiana 
she taps the keyboard 
h-o-u-n-d 
that's as far as my access goes 
i'm afraid 
there must be an override 
a password 
i imagine so 
but that'd be major barrymore's 
password password password 
he sat here when he thought it up 
describe him to me you've seen him 
but describe him 
he's a bloody martinet 
a throw-back 
the sort they'd have sent into suez 
good excellent old-fashioned 
traditionalist not the sort to use 
his children's name as a password 
he loves his job proud of it 
and this is work-related 
so what's at eye level 
books 
jane's defence weekly bound copies 
hannibal 
wellington rommel churchill's 
history of the english-speaking 
peoples all four volumes 
churchill he's fond of churchill 
copy of the downing street years 
one to five 
separate biographies of thatcher 
mid-1980s at a guess 
father and son 
barrymore senior medals 
distinguished service order 
that date i'd say falklands veteran 
right thatcher's a more likely bet 
than churchill that's the password 
no with a man like major barrymore 
only first name terms would do 
machine beeps wildly 
hound 
hm 
jesus 
project hound a new deliriant drug 
which rendered its users 
incredibly suggestible 
they wanted to use it 
as an anti-personnel weapon 
to totally disorientate the enemy 
using fear and stimulus 
but they shut it down 
and hid it away in 1986 
because of what it did 
to the subjects they tested it on 
and what they did to others 
prolonged exposure drove them 
insane made them almost 
uncontrollably aggressive 
so someone's been doing it again 
carrying on the experiments 
attempting to refine it perhaps 
for the last 20 years who 
those names mean anything to you 
no not a thing 
maybe our friend's somewhere 
in the back of the picture 
someone old enough to be there at 
the time of the experiments in 1986 
maybe somebody who says "cell phone" 
because of time spent in america 
you remember john hm-mm 
here's my uh cell number 
he gave us his number 
in case we needed him 
oh my god bob frankland 
but bob doesn't work on 
he's a virologist 
this is chemical warfare 
that's where he started though 
he's never lost the certainty 
the obsession that that drug 
really could work 
nice of him to give us his number 
let's arrange a little meeting 
phone rings 
hello 
woman sobs on the phone 
who's this you've got to find henry 
it's louise mortimer 
louise what's wrong 
henry was was remembering then 
he tried 
he's got a gun he went 
for the gun and tried to what 
she sobs 
he's gone but you've got to stop 
him i don't know what he might do 
where where are you 
his house i'm ok i'm ok 
right stay there 
we'll get someone to you ok 
henry he's attacked her gone hm 
there's only one place he'll go 
back to where it started 
lestrade get to the hollow dewer's 
hollow now and bring a gun 
feral squeal echoes 
he pants 
i'm sorry 
i'm so sorry dad 
no henry no no get back 
get away from me 
easy henry easy just relax 
i know what i am 
i know what i tried to do 
just put the gun down it's ok 
no no i know what i am 
yes i'm sure you do henry 
it's all been explained to you 
hasn't it 
explained very carefully what 
someone needed to keep you quiet 
needed to keep you as a child 
to reassert the dream 
you both clung on to 
because you had started to remember 
remember now henry you've got 
to remember what happened here 
when you were a little boy 
i thought it had got my dad 
the hound i thought oh jesus 
i don'ti don't know any more 
i don't 
no henry henry for god's sake 
henry remember 
two words a frightened little boy 
saw here 20 years ago you'd started 
to piece things together 
remember what happened here 
that night 
it wasn't an animal was it henry 
not a monster 
a man 
attacker grunts like an animal 
boy pants in fear 
the man pants with exertion 
muted scream 
you couldn't cope 
you were just a child 
so you rationalised it 
into something very different 
then you started to remember 
so you had to be stopped 
driven out of your mind 
so that no-one would believe a word 
that you said 
sherlock 
it's ok 
it's ok mate 
but we saw it the hound 
last night we did we s 
no but there was a dog henry 
leaving footprints 
scaring witnesses but nothing more 
than an ordinary dog 
we both saw it saw it as our 
drugged minds wanted us to see it 
fear and stimulus 
that's how it works 
but there never was any monster 
howls and snarls 
sherlock 
no no no no no 
henry henry sherlock 
no no no no no noooo 
henry 
dog snarls aggressively 
sherlock are you seeing this 
right he is not drugged sherlock 
so what's that oh oh no 
what is it 
all right it's still here 
but it's just a dog henry it's 
nothing more than an ordinary dog 
my god 
animal snarls fiercely 
oh christ 
dog continues to snarl 
he breathes heavily through the mask 
no no 
snarling echoes 
it's not you not you 
argh urgh 
he breathes heavily 
the fog what it's the fog 
the drug it's in the fog 
aerosol dispersant that's what it 
said in the records project hound 
it's the fog 
a chemical minefield 
dog snarls 
for god's sake kill it kill it 
loud gunshots 
animal squeals in pain 
then falls silent 
look at it henry 
no no no come on look at it 
you bastard 
youbastard 
making no sense it's all over now 
come on 
why didn't you just kill me 
because dead men get listened to 
he needed to do more than kill you 
he had to discredit every word 
you ever said about your father 
and he had the means 
right at his feet 
a chemical minefield 
pressure pads in the ground 
dosing you up every time 
that you came back here 
murder weapon 
and scene of the crime all at once 
ha ha oh this case henry 
thank you 
it's been brilliant sherlock what 
timing 
not good no no it's ok 
it's fine because this means 
this means that my dad was right 
he'd found something out hadn't he 
and that's why you killed him 
because he was right 
and he'd found you right 
in the middle of an experiment 
sound of dog snarling and growling 
gunshots 
frankland 
frankland keep running 
come on keep up 
it's no use frankland 
warning alarm beeps 
his breathing slows 
he sighs 
thanks bill 
so they didn't have it put down 
then the dog obviously 
i suppose they just couldn't 
bring themselves to do it 
i see 
no you don't 
no i don't sentiment sentiment 
listen what happened to me 
in the lab 
do you want some sauce with that 
i hadn't been to the hollow 
how come i heard those things there 
fear and stimulus you said 
you must have been dosed with it 
elsewhere in the lab maybe 
you saw those pipes 
pretty ancient leaky as a sieve 
and they were carrying the gas 
so um ketchup was it or brown 
hang on 
you thought it was in the sugar you 
were convinced it was in the sugar 
i'd better get going 
there's a train leaving 
in half an hour so if you want 
oh god it was you 
you locked me in that bloody lab 
i had to it was an experiment 
an experiment ssh 
i was terrified scared to death 
i thought the drug was in the sugar 
so i put some in your coffee 
then i arranged everything with 
major barrymore totally scientific 
laboratory conditions literally 
sound of growling 
keep talking i'll find you 
keep talking (i can't it'll hear 
me) tell me what you're seeing 
he taps a key: 
sound of growling echoes 
i don't know but i can hear it now 
i knew what effect it had had on 
a superior mind so i needed to try 
it on an average one 
you know what i mean 
but it wasn't in the sugar no well 
i wasn't to know you'd already been 
exposed to the gas so you got it 
wrong no hmm 
you were wrong it wasn't in 
the sugar you got it wrong a bit 
it won't happen again 
any long-term effects 
none at all you'll be fine once 
you've excreted it we all will 
i think i might have taken care 
of that already 
where are you going 
i won't be a minute 
got to see a man about a dog 
all right let him go

back up i need maximum back up 
baker street now 
what's going on 
this is hard what 
really hard 
hardest thing i've ever had to do 
do you know any funny stories 
about john 
what 
i need anecdotes 
didn't go to any trouble did you 
shut up mrs hudson 
i haven't said a word 
you're formulating a question 
it's physically painful 
watching you think 
i thought it was you playing 
it was me playing 
i am composing 
you were dancing 
i was road-testing 
you what 
why are you here 
i'm bringing you your morning tea 
you're not usually awake 
you bring me tea in the morning 
well where do you think 
it came from 
i don't know 
i just thought it sort of happened 
your mother has a lot to answer for 
hmm i know i have a list 
mycroft has a file 
so it's the big day then 
what big day 
the wedding john and mary 
getting married 
two people who currently live 
together are about to attend church 
have a party go on a short holiday 
then carry on living together 
what's big about that 
it changes people marriage 
hmm no it doesn't 
well you wouldn't understand 
cos you always live alone 
your husband was executed 
for double murder 
you're hardly an advert 
for companionship 
marriage changes you as a person 
in ways that you can't imagine 
as does lethal injection 
my best friend margaret 
she was my chief bridesmaid 
we were going to be best friends 
forever we always said that 
but i hardly saw her after that 
aren't there usually biscuits 
i've run out have the shops 
she cried the whole day saying 
i'm sure the shop 
on the corner is open 
she was probably right really 
i remember she left early 
i mean who leaves a wedding early 
so sad 
hmm anyway you've got 
things to do 
no not really i've got plenty of 
time to get ready biscuits 
oh i really am going to 
have a word with your mother 
you can if you like 
she understands very little 
right then 
into battle 
congratulations 
ok hold it there i want to get 
this shot of the newlyweds 
er just the bride and groom 
please 
sherlock 
oh sorry 
ok three two one cheese 
the famous mr holmes 
i'm very pleased to meet you 
but no sex ok sorry 
you don't have to look so scared 
i'm only messing 
bridesmaid best man 
it's a bit traditional 
is it but not obligatory 
if that's the sort of thing you're looking for 
the man over there in blue is your best bet 
recently divorced doctor 
with a ginger cat 
a barn conversion and a history 
of erectile dysfunction 
reviewing that information 
possibly not your best bet 
yeah maybe not 
sorry there was one more deduction 
there than i was expecting 
mr holmes you're going 
to be incredibly useful 
hello lovely to meet you 
how are you 
beautiful mary 
thank you 
congratulations 
david 
ah ah mary congratulations 
you look um very nice 
thanks john congratulations 
you're a lucky man thank you 
um david this is sherlock hmm 
um yeah we've um we've met 
so what exactly are my duties 
as an usher 
let's talk about mary first 
sorry what 
well i think you know what 
you went out with her for two years 
er ages ago we're 
we're just good friends now 
is that a fact 
whenever she tweets you respond within five 
minutes regardless of time or current location 
suggesting you have her on text alert in your 
facebook photographs of the happy couple 
mary takes centre frame whereas john 
is always partly or entirely excluded 
well you can't assume from that i've still 
got some kind of interest in mary 
you volunteered to be a shoulder to cry on 
on no less than three separate occasions 
do you have anything to say 
in your defence 
i think from now on we'll downgrade 
you to casual acquaintance 
no more than three planned 
social encounters a year 
and always in john's presence 
i have your contact details 
i will be monitoring 
they're right about you 
you're a bloody psychopath 
high functioning sociopath 
with your number 
um 
hello darling thank you 
you look fabulous thank you 
thanks for coming thank you 
er yes well done in the service 
archie 
he's really come out of his shell 
i don't know how you did it um 
basically it's a cute smile 
to the bride's side 
cute smile to the groom's side 
and then the rings no 
and you have to wear the outfit no 
you really do have to wear 
the outfit what for 
grown-ups like that sort of thing 
why 
i don't know i'll ask one 
you're a detective 
yep have you solved any murders 
sure loads can i see 
yeah all right 
what's all the stuff in his eye 
maggots cool 
hmm 
he said you had some 
pictures for him as a treat 
er yes if he's good 
beheadings lovely little village 
hmm what did you say 
hold it 
nice 
i'm starving thanks 
i had to lose so much weight to 
get into this dress 
hmm he's nice 
traces of two leading brands of deodorant 
both advertised for their strength 
suggestive of a chronic body odour 
problem manifesting under stress 
ok done there 
what about his friend 
long-term relationship 
compulsive cheat seriously 
waterproof cover on his smart-phone 
yet his complexion 
doesn't indicate outdoor work 
it suggests he's in the habit of taking 
his phone into the shower with him 
which means he often receives texts and emails 
he'd rather went unseen can i keep you 
do you like solving crimes 
do you have a vacancy 
so harry er no no show 
darling i'm so sorry 
yeah it was a bit of a punt 
asking her i suppose 
still free bar 
wouldn't have been a good mix 
oh god wow 
is that he came 
so that's him major sholto 
uh-huh 
if they're such good friends 
why does he barely even mention him 
he mentions him all the time to me 
never shuts up about him 
about him mm-hmm 
urgh i chose this wine 
it's bloody awful 
yes but it's definitely him 
that he talks about mm-hmm 
i'm very very glad to see you sir 
i know you don't really 
do this sort of thing 
well i do for old friends 
watson 
john 
it's good to see you you too 
civilian life suiting you then 
er er yes well i think so sir 
no more need for the trick cyclist 
no i go now and then 
sort of a top-up 
therapy can be very helpful 
where are you living these days 
oh way out in the middle of 
nowhere you wouldn't know it 
you look well i've never even 
heard him say his name 
well he's almost a recluse 
you know since yes 
i didn't think he'd show up at all 
john says he's the most unsociable 
man he's ever met 
he is he's the most unsociable 
hmm 
ah that's why he's bouncing around 
him like a puppy 
oh sherlock 
neither of us were the first 
you know stop smiling 
it's my wedding day 
urgh 
yes what sherlock 
why are you out of breath filing 
either i've caught you in a compromising 
position or you've been working out again 
i favour the latter 
what do you want 
i need your answer mycroft 
as a matter of urgency 
answer even at the eleventh hour 
it's not too late you know 
oh lord 
cars can be ordered 
private jets commandeered 
today it's today isn't it 
no sherlock i will not be 
coming to the night-do 
as you so poetically put it 
what a shame 
mary and john will be extremely d 
delighted not to have me 
hanging around 
oh i don't know 
there should always be 
a spectre at the feast 
so this is it then the big day 
i suppose i'll be seeing 
a lot more of you from now on 
what do you mean 
just like old times 
no i don't understand 'well 
it's the end of an era isn't it' 
john and mary domestic bliss 
no no no i prefer to think of it 
as the beginning of a new chapter 
what nothing 
i know that silence what 
well i'd better let you 
get back to it 
you have a big speech or something 
don't you 
what cakes karaoke mingling 
mycroft this is what people do 
sherlock they get married 
i warned you don't get involved 
involved i'm not involved no 
john asked me to be his best man how could i say no 
absolutely i'm not involved 
i believe you really i do 
have a lovely day and do give 
the happy couple my best 
i will 
oh by the way sherlock 
do you remember redbeard 
i'm not a child anymore mycroft 
no of course you're not 
enjoy not getting involved sherlock 
pray silence for the best man 
ladies and gentlemen 
family and friends 
and 
um others 
er 
a-also 
greg molly 
i've just had a thought 
is that a brain 
what if john asks sherlock 
to be his best man 
well he will won't he 
he's bound to exactly 
so so he'll have to make a speech 
in front of people 
there'll be actual people there 
actually listening 
well what's the worst 
that could happen 
helen-louise probably 
wondered the same 
helen-louise 
oh hello dear 
i was just thinking 
if john does ask sherlock 
what the speech dear 
no it'll be fine 
it's not just the speech 
though is it 
oh brilliant 
mrs hudson hello darling 
are you all right 
i was coming to see sherlock 
and i thought you were 
no possibly dying 
oh sorry 
what's wrong 
the telegrams 
sorry what 
oh sorry 
telegrams 
right um 
first things first telegrams 
well they're not actually telegrams we 
just call them telegrams i don't know why 
wedding tradition 
because we don't have enough of that 
already apparently 
you on your special day 
mike stanford" aah aw 
wishes for your special day" 
from stella and ted" 
yeah 
and heaps of good wishes from cam" 
could have seen this" 
bit of a theme you get the general 
gist people are basically fond 
john watson 
my friend john watson 
john 
when john first broached the subject 
of being best man i was confused 
sherlock what was that 
noise downstairs 
oh it was mrs hudson laughing 
hmm it sounded like 
she was torturing an owl 
yeah well it was laughter 
could have been both 
busy 
oh just occupying myself 
sometimes it's so hard not smoking 
mind if i interrupt 
be my guest 
tea er 
so er the big question 
mm-hmm 
the best man 
the best man 
what do you think 
billy kincaid 
sorry what billy kincaid the camden 
garrotter best man i ever knew 
vast contributions to charity 
never disclosed 
personally managed to save 
three hospitals from closure 
and ran the best and safest 
children's homes in north england 
yes every now and again there'd be some garrotings but 
stacking up the lives saved against the garrotings 
on balance i'd say he 
for my wedding 
for me i need a best man 
oh right maybe not a garrotter 
gavin who 
gavin lestrade 
he's a man and good at it 
it's greg 
and he's not my best friend 
oh mike stanford i see 
well he's nice um though i'm not 
sure how well he'd cope with all 
no mike's great 
but he's not my best friend 
look sherlock this is the biggest 
and most important day of my life 
well no it is it is 
and i want to be up there 
with the two people 
that i love and care about 
most in the world yes 
so mary morstan yes 
and 
i confess at first i didn't realise 
he was asking me 
when finally i understood i expressed to him 
that i was both flattered and surprised 
i explained to him that i'd never expected this 
request and i was a little daunted in the face of it 
sherlock 
i nonetheless promised i would do my very 
best to accomplish a task which was for me 
as demanding and difficult 
as any i had ever contemplated 
additionally i thanked him for the trust 
he placed in me and indicated that i was 
in some ways very close to 
being moved by it 
no it's getting a bit scary now 
it later transpired that i'd said 
none of this out loud 
so in fact 
you you mean yes 
i'm your 
best man 
yeah of course you are 
of course you're my best friend 
how was that 
surprisingly ok 
so you'll have to make a speech 
of course 
done that done that 
done that bit done that bit 
done that bit hmm 
i'm afraid john 
i can't congratulate you 
all emotions 
and in particular love 
stand opposed to the pure cold 
reason i hold above all things 
a wedding is 
in my considered opinion 
nothing short of a celebration of all 
that is false and specious and irrational 
and sentimental in this ailing 
and morally compromised world 
today we honour the deathwatch beetle 
that is the doom of our society 
and in time one feels certain 
our entire species 
but anyway let's talk about john 
please 
if i burden myself with a little 
helpmate during my adventures 
this is not out of sentiment or caprice it 
is that he has many fine qualities of his own 
that he has overlooked 
in his obsession with me 
indeed any reputation i have for mental 
acuity and sharpness comes in truth 
from the extraordinary contrast 
john so selflessly provides 
it is a fact i believe that brides tend to favour 
exceptionally plain bridesmaids for their big day 
there is a certain analogy there 
i feel and contrast is after all 
god's own plan to enhance 
the beauty of his creation 
or it would be if god were not 
a ludicrous fantasy 
designed to provide a career 
opportunity for the family idiot 
the point i'm trying to make 
is that i am 
the most unpleasant rude 
ignorant and all-round 
obnoxious arsehole 
that anyone could possibly have 
the misfortune to meet 
i am dismissive of the virtuous 
unaware of the beautiful 
and uncomprehending 
in the face of the happy 
so if i didn't understand 
i was being asked to be best man 
it is because i never expected 
to be anybody's best friend 
and certainly not the best friend 
of the bravest and kindest 
and wisest human being 
i have ever had the good fortune 
of knowing 
john i am a ridiculous man 
redeemed only by the warmth 
and constancy of your friendship 
but as i am apparently 
your best friend 
i cannot congratulate you 
on your choice of companion 
actually now i can 
mary when i say 
you deserve this man 
it is the highest compliment 
of which i am capable 
john you have endured war 
and injury and tragic loss - 
so sorry again about that last one - 
so know this today you sit between 
the woman you have made your wife 
and the man you have saved 
in short the two people who love 
you most in all this world 
and i know i speak for mary as well 
when i say 
we will never let you down and we 
have a lifetime ahead to prove that 
certainly not 
ah yes now onto 
some funny stories about john 
what's wrong what happened 
why are you all doing that john 
oh sherlock 
did i do it wrong 
no you didn't come here 
i haven't finished yet 
yeah i know i know 
so onto some funny stories now 
can you wait till i sit down 
so onto some funny stories 
about john 
if you could all just cheer up 
a bit that would be better 
on we go 
so for funny stories one has to 
look no further than john's blog 
the record of our time together 
of course he does 
tend to romanticise things a bit 
but then you know he's a romantic 
we've tackled some strange cases 
the hollow client 
the poison giant 
get down john 
we've had some frustrating cases 
what is that 
a french decathlete found 
completely out of his mind 
surrounded by 1812 matchboxes 
all empty except this one 
and what's in that one 
inexplicable 
touching cases 
she's going to ring the doorbell 
oh no she's changed her mind 
oh she's going to do it 
no she's leaving 
she's leaving 
oh she's coming back 
she's a client she's boring i've 
seen those symptoms before hmm 
oscillation on the pavement 
always means there's a love affair 
and of course i have to mention 
the elephant in the room 
but we want something 
very particular for this 
special day don't we 
the bloody guardsman 
need to work on your half of the 
church mary looking a bit thin

opera house please 
oh hang on i'm buzzing

he's going to figure out that it's code 
he's youtubing serviettes he's thorough 
he's terrified of course he's not 
when you're scared of something you start 
wishing it sooner just to get it all going 
but why would he be scared 
that we're getting married 
it's not going to change anything 
we'll still do stuff 
you need to prove it to him 
i told you to find him a new case 
i'm trying but you need to run him ok 
show him it's still the good old days 
that just sort of happened 
sherlock um mate

of cake which all tasted identical 
i like the bridesmaids in purple 
lilac lilac 
um there are no more decisions 
left to make 
i don't even understand the decisions 
that we have made

death threats than you oh i wouldn't count on that 
and why have you suddenly taken 
an interest in another human being

right me and mary getting married 
we'll still be doing all this 
oh good if you were worried 
i wasn't worried 
hmm 
the thing about mary

hmm 
i've seen you in the papers 
you hang around with that detective 
the one with the silly hat 
what the hell does bainbridge 
want with a detective 
i'm afraid i'm not at liberty to say 
you're not at liberty to say 
he's a soldier in my regiment 
i'll be damned if he's going to get up to 
cloak-and-dagger nonsense like this sir 
sir what's going on 
it's bainbridge sir 
he's dead 
my god 
ah no let me take a look 
sir i'm a doctor 
what 
sergeant arrest this man 
what no no i'm a doctor 
oh you're a doctor 
now too sergeant 
let me examine him please 
sir caught this one 
snooping around 
is that what this is all about 
distracting me so that 
this man could get in here 
and kill bainbridge don't be 
kill him with what 
where's the weapon what 
where's the weapon 
go on search me - no weapon 
bainbridge was on parade 
he came off duty five minutes ago 
when's this supposed 
to have happened 
you obviously stabbed him before 
he got into the shower no no 
he's soaking wet and there's shampoo in his hair 
he got into the shower then someone stabbed him 
the cubicle was locked from the 
inside sir i had to break it open 
you must have climbed over the top but 
then i'd be soaking wet too wouldn't i 
major please i'm john watson 
fifth northumberland fusiliers 
three years in afghanistan 
a veteran of kandahar helmand 
and bart's bloody hospital 
let me examine this body 
thank you 
suicide 
no the weapon again no knife 
now there is a wound 
to the abdomen 
incredibly fine 
man stabbed to death 
no murder weapon 
door locked from the inside 
only one way in or out 
of here sherlock 
hmm he's still breathing 
oh my god 
what do we do 
give me your scarf what 
quickly now call an ambulance 
what call an ambulance now 
do it 
nurse press here hard 
nurse yeah i'm making do 
keep pressure on that wound 
stephen stephen stay with me 
private bainbridge had 
just come off guard duty 
he'd stood there for hours 
plenty of people watching 
nothing apparently wrong 
he came off duty and 
within minutes was nearly dead 
from a wound in his stomach 
but there was no weapon 
where did it go 
ladies and gentlemen 
i invite you to consider this - 
a murderer who can 
walk through walls 
a weapon that can vanish 
but in all of this 
there is only one element which can 
be said to be truly remarkable 
would anyone like to make a guess 
come on come on 
there is actually an element 
of q&a to all of this 
scotland yard 
have you got a theory 
yeah you you're a detective 
broadly speaking got a theory 
er um if the er 
if the if the 
if the blade was 
propelled through the erm 
maybe a ballista 
or a catapult um 
somebody tiny could crawl in there 
so yeah we're looking 
for a dwarf 
brilliant 
really no 
next 
hello who was that 
tom 
got a theory 
attempted suicide with a blade 
made of compacted blood and bone 
broke after piercing his abdomen 
like a meat 
dagger 
a meat dagger 
yes (sit down) 
no 
there was one feature 
and only one feature of interest 
in the whole of this baffling case 
and quite frankly it was 
the usual - john watson 
who while i was trying to solve 
a murder instead saved a life 
there are mysteries worth solving 
and stories worth telling 
the best and bravest man i know 
and on top of that 
he actually knows how to do stuff 
except wedding planning and 
serviettes he's rubbish at those 
hmm the case itself remains 
the most ingenious and brilliantly 
planned murder or attempted murder 
i've ever had 
the pleasure to encounter 
the most perfect locked-room 
mystery of which i am aware 
however i'm not just here 
to praise john 
i'm also here to embarrass him 
so let's move on to 
no wait how was it done 
how was what done the stabbing 
i'm afraid i don't know 
i didn't solve that one 
it can happen sometimes 
it's very very disappointing 
embarrassment leads me on 
to the stag night 
of course there's 
hours of material here 
but i've cut it down 
to the really good bits 
murder scenes 
locations of murders 
hmm pub crawl themed 
yeah but why can't you just 
do underground stations 
it lacks the personal touch we're 
going to go for a drink in every 
in every street where you've 
found a corpse delightful 
where do i come in 
don't want to get ill 
that would ruin it spoil the mood 
you're a graduate chemist 
can't you just work it out 
i lack the practical experience 
meaning you think i like a drink 
occasionally 
that i'm a drunk no no 
you look well 
i am 
how's 
tom 
not a sociopath 
still good 
and we're having quite a lot of sex 
ok i want you to calculate 
john's ideal intake and mine 
to remain in the sweet spot 
for the whole evening 
light-headed - good 
urinating in wardrobes - bad 
hmm 
two erm beers please 
pints 
ah 
what are we on a schedule 
you'll thank me 
cheers cheers 
over there what 
toilets - any second now 
you're going to need 
hang on tell me after 
i need the loo hmm on schedule

estimate approximate 
volume discharge 
stop talking now 
oh quick one more he mustn't see

all right enough 
that's stand up 
ash i know ash 
i have an international reputation 
do you have 
an international reputation 
no i don't have 
an international reputation no 
and i can't even remember what for 
it's crime something or other 
oh what are you doing back 
i thought you were 
going to be up late 
ah hudders what time is it 
you've only been out two hours 
am i a vegetable

hmm nice 
ish 
clever 
i would say so 
you would 
hmm am i important 
to some people

the wrong way 
ok

you know we don't have a king 
don't we no 
your go 
i don't mind am i a woman 
what

this 
beauty is a construct based 
entirely on childhood impressions 
influences and role models 
yeah but am i a pretty lady 
i don't know who you are i don't 
know who you're supposed to be 
you picked the name 
but i picked it at random 
from the papers 
you're not really getting the hang 
of this game are you sherlock 
so i am human i'm not as tall 
as people think i am i'm 
i'm nice-ish clever 
important to some people 
but i tend to rub them up 
the wrong way 
got it 
go on then i'm you aren't i 
client 
hello 
hello come on 
which one of you is sherlock holmes 
i don't a lot 
i mean i don't date all that much 
and he seemed nice you know 
we seemed to automatically connect 
we had one night 
dinner such interesting 
conversation 
it was lovely 
to be honest 
i'd love to have gone further 
but i thought no this is special 
let's take it slowly 
exchanged numbers 
he said he'd get in touch 
and then 
maybe he wasn't quite 
as keen as i was 
but i just thought 
at least he'd call 
to say that we were finished 
i went round there 
to his flat no trace of him 
mr holmes i honestly think 
i had dinner with a ghost 
mr holmes 
with a ghost mr holmes 
boring boring boring 
no 
fascinating 
john john wake up 
i apologise about my 
you know him 
rude rude 
i checked with the landlord 
and the man who lived there died 
heart attack 
and there we are 
having dinner one week on 
and i found this thing online 
a sort of chatroom thing 
for girls who think they're dating 
men from the spirit world 
don't worry i'll find him 
in ten minutes 
what's your dog's name 
yeah i'm there if you want it 
john wake up 
went to yeah 
the game is something 
on 
yeah that that 
ok 
oh it's nice 
nice place

any clues mr holmes 
oh errrm 
i'm just going to whip this out 
you all right 
hmm yeah he's clueing what 
he's hmm he's clueing for looks 
mr holmes 
mr holmes i'm calling 
the police oh no 
whoa whoa whoa 
no look this is 
a famous detective 
it's sherlock holmes and 
his partner john hamish watson 
what do you think you're doing 
don't compromise 
the integrity of the 
crime scene 
yeah that 
wakey-wakey 
oh my god 
greg is that greg 
get up i'm going to 
put you two in a taxi 
i managed to square things 
with the desk sergeant 
ha what a couple of lightweights - 
you couldn't even make it 
to closing time 
come on 
well thanks for a 
you know an evening 
it was awful 
yeah i was going to pretend but 
it was truly 
that woman tessa 
what 
dated a ghost most interesting 
case for months 
what a wasted opportunity 
ok 
how are you feeling 
hmm 
it's just like old times 
having you back here 
i thought i'd make your 
favourite one last time 
oh don't sound so final about it 
i will be visiting you know 
ooh i've heard that one before 
no it's different now 
though isn't it 
it's different to when 
we thought we'd lost him 
well marriage 
changes everything john 
does it yeah you might not 
think it but it does 
it's a different phase in your life 
you meet knew people 
cos you're a couple 
and then you just let 
your old friends slip away 
it won't be like that 
well if you've found the right one 
the person that you click with 
it's the best thing in the world 
well i have i know i have 
oh i'm sure 
she's lovely 
yeah i think so what about you 
me 
did you think you'd found the right 
one when you married mr hudson 
no it was just 
a whirlwind thing for us 
i knew it wouldn't work but i just 
got sort of swept along right 
and then we moved to florida 
we had a fantastic time 
but of course i didn't know 
what he was up to (the drugs) 
drugs he was running erm 
oh what do you call it 
erm a 
cartel 
and got in with a really bad crowd 
right and then i found out 
about all the other women 
i didn't have a clue 
so when he was actually arrested 
for blowing someone's head off 
it was quite a relief to be honest 
oh 
it was purely physical 
between me and frank 
we couldn't keep 
our hands off each other 
i know there was one night 
oh is that sherlock 
is it 
that's sherlock 
urgh 
there are going to be others 
others victims women 
most ghosts tend to 
haunt a single house 
this ghost however 
is willing to commute look 
hmm 
not you not you 
not you not you not you not you 
not you not you 
not you 
not you not you 
hmm 
not you 
not you not you not you 
not you not you not you 
not you not you 
not you not you not you 
not you you you or you or you 
or not you not you not you

hi 
gail 
charlotte 
robyn 
vicky 
how did you meet 
came up to me in a pub 
same gym as me 
we just got chatting on the bus 
online 
name told you 
his name oscar 
mike terry 
erm love monkey 
your place 
his place 
address 
nothing happened 
it was just very romantic 
four women in four nights 
he must have something special 
he was very charming he listened 
he was sweet 
he had a lovely 
you ok 
you've let your food go cold 
mrs hudson will play hell 
not now john 
sorry about that 
he had a lovely manner 
different names 
different addresses 
describe him 
short blonde hair 
dark hair long 
ginger i like gingers 
couldn't tell 
he had a mask on 
he's stealing 
the identity of corpses 
getting their names 
from the obituary columns 
all single men 
he's using the dead man's flat 
under the assumption 
it will be empty for a while 
free love nest 
i feel sick 
it's gruesome 
that's awful clever 
bastard 
hello tessa 
meanwhile back to business 
no-one wants to use 
a dead man's home 
at least not until 
it's been cleared 
so he disguises himself 
steals the man's home 
steals his identity 
but only for one night 
then he's gone 
he's not a ghost john 
he's a mayfly 
he lives for a day 
so what was it 
he was looking for 
job 
gardener cook 
private nurse i do security work 
maid 
obvious you all work 
for the same person 
no no not the same employer damn 
come on we can do this 
ideal night out 
clay-pigeon shooting 
line dancing 
pictures 
wine in front of the telly 
dungeon 
make-up clarins 
no7 
maybelline nothing special 
whatever's cheap 
perfume 
chanel chanel chanel 
chanel estee lauder 
ideal man 
george clooney 
oh home-loving 
he'd have to like cuddling 
caring ten things 
one - someone who isn't 
competitive with other men 
two - someone who isn't constantly 
trying to define himself 
by his masculinity 
there's a unifying factor 
there has to be 
none of you reported 
anything stolen 
security guard gardener cook 
maid private nurse 
he's romancing his way 
up a pecking order 
somebody's pecking order 
come on think unless 
do you have a secret 
you've never told anyone 
no 
gotcha what do you mean 
everyone has secrets and 
they all replied too quickly 
got to go see you no wait 
bye-bye wait 
sorry sexy some secrets 
have to stay secret 
enjoy the wedding 
why why would he date all of those 
women and not return their calls 
you're missing 
the obvious mate am i 
he's a man 
but why would he 
change his identity 
maybe he's married 
oh 
married 
obvious really 
our mayfly man 
was trying to escape 
the suffocating 
chains of domesticity 
and instead of endless nights in 
watching the telly 
or going to barbecues with the awful 
dreadful boring people he couldn't stand 
he used his wits cleverness and powers 
of disguise to play the field he was 
on second thoughts 
i probably should have told you 
about the elephant in the room 
however it does help 
to further illustrate 
how invaluable john is to me 
i can read a crime scene the way 
he can understand a human being 
i used to think that's what made me 
special - quite frankly i still do 
but a word to the wise 
should any of you require 
the services of either of us 
i will solve your murder 
but it takes john watson 
to save your life 
trust me on that i should know 
he's saved mine so many times 
and in so many ways 
this blog is the story of two men 
and their frankly 
ridiculous adventures 
of murder mystery and mayhem 
but from now on 
there's a new story 
a bigger adventure 
ladies and gentlemen 
pray charge your glasses 
and be upstanding 
today begin the adventures 
of mary elizabeth watson 
and john hamish watson 
the two reasons why 
every single one of us is 
what did you say 
you said 
you said that you said "hamish" 
this is a famous detective 
it's sherlock holmes 
and his partner john hamish watson 
how did you know 
how did you know his middle name 
he never tells anyone he hates it 
john "h" watson 
yep 
henry shut up 
humphrey 
shut up 
shower runs higgins 
it took him years to confide in me 
oh 
that's my birth certificate 
yep 
and the woman - she knew 
hamish 
john hamish watson 
just if you were 
looking for baby names 
god knows where she is 
out of my head i am busy 
there's only one time 
that name's been made public 
does it have to be on the invitation 
it's your name 
it's traditional it's funny 
enjoy the wedding 
the wedding 
you knew about the wedding 
more importantly you'd seen 
a wedding invitation 
now barely 100 people 
had seen that invitation 
the mayfly man only saw five women 
for one person 
to be in both groups 
could be a coincidence 
oh sherlock 
what do we say about coincidences 
the universe is rarely so lazy 
so the balance of probability is 
someone went to great lengths 
to find out something about this wedding what great lengths 
they lied assumed false identities 
which suggests criminal intent 
also suggests 
intelligence planning 
clearly but more importantly 
the mayfly man 
the mayfly man is 
here today 
ooh sorry i 
another glass sir 
thank you yes thank you yes 
something's going to happen 
right here 
now where were we 
could be any second 
you have control of the room 
ah yes 
raising glasses and standing up 
very good thank you 
don't lose it 
and down again 
ladies and gentlemen 
people tell you not 
to milk a good speech 
get off early leave 'em laughing 
wise advice i'll certainly 
try to bear in mind 
but for now 
part two 
part two is more action-based 
i'm going to walk around 
shake things up a bit 
who'd go to a wedding 
that's the question 
who would bother 
to go to any lengths 
to get themselves to a wedding 
well everyone 
weddings are great love a wedding 
what's he doing 
something's wrong 
and john's great too 
haven't said that enough 
barely scratched the surface 
i could go on all night 
about the depth and complexity 
of his jumpers 
and he can cook 
does erm a thing 
a thing with peas 
once might not be peas 
might not be him 
but he's got a great singing voice 
or somebody does 
too many too many 
too many too many 
sorry too many jokes about john 
now criminal intent 
where was i ah yes 
extraordinary lengths 
speech speech 
let's talk about 
all of which is suggestive of 
murder sorry did i say murder 
i meant to say marriage 
but you know 
they're quite similar procedures 
when you think about it 
the participants tend 
to know each other 
and it's over 
when one of them's dead 
in fairness murder is a lot quicker 
though janine what about this one 
acceptably hot more importantly his 
girlfriend's wearing new uncomfortable underwear 
and hasn't bothered to pick this thread off his 
jacket or point out the grease smudge on his neck 
he's going home alone 
also he's a comics and sci-fi geek 
they're always tremendously 
grateful really put the hours in 
jeff the gents 
loos now please 
greg the loos please why 
oh i don't know 
maybe it's your turn 
yeah actually 
now you mention it 
sherlock any chance of a 
an end date for this speech 
got to cut the cake 
oh ladies and gentlemen 
can't stand it when i finally 
get the chance to speak for once 
vatican cameos 
what did he say 
what does that mean 
battle stations 
someone's going to die 
what 
narrow it down narrow it down 
narrow it down 
argh no no 
not you 
you it's always you 
john watson you keep me right 
what do i do 
you've already done it 
don't solve the murder 
save the life 
sorry off piste a bit 
back now phew 
let's play a game 
let's play murder 
sherlock 
imagine someone's going to 
get murdered at a wedding 
who exactly would you pick 
i think you're a popular choice 
at the moment dear 
if someone could move mrs hudson's 
glass just slightly out of reach 
that would be lovely 
more importantly who could you 
only kill at a wedding 
most people you can kill 
any old place 
as a mental exercise 
i've often planned the murder 
of friends and colleagues 
now john i'd poison 
sloppy eater dead easy i've given 
him chemicals and compounds 
that way he's never even noticed 
he missed a whole wednesday once 
didn't have a clue 
lestrade's so easy to kill it's a miracle 
no-one's succumbed to the temptation 
i've got keys to my brother's house i could 
break in and asphyxiate him if the whim arose 
he's pissed isn't he ow 
so once again 
who could you only kill here 
clearly it's a rare opportunity 
so it's someone 
who doesn't get out much 
someone for whom 
a planned social encounter 
known about months in advance 
is an exception 
has to be a unique opportunity 
and since killing someone 
in public is difficult 
killing them in private 
isn't an option 
someone who lives in an inaccessible 
or unknown location then 
someone private perhaps 
obsessed with personal security 
possibly someone under threat 
major james sholto who he 
i don't think he's coming 
he'll be there 
where are you living these days 
oh way out in 
the middle of nowhere 
the press and families 
gave him hell 
he gets more death threats than you 
a recluse 
small household staff 
job gardener cook 
private nurse maid 
high turnover 
for additional security 
i do security work probably all 
signed confidentiality agreements 
do you have a secret you've 
never told anyone all: no 
there is another question that 
remains rather a big one 
a huge one - how would you do it 
how do you kill someone in public 
there has to be a way 
this has been planned 
mr holmes hello archie 
what's your theory 
get this right and there's 
a headless nun in it for you 
the invisible man could do it 
the who what why when where 
the invisible man with the invisible knife 
the one who tried to kill the guardsman 
bainbridge 
bainbridge 
planned and rehearsed) 
ladies and gentlemen 
there will now be a short interlude 
the bride and groom 
the bride and groom 
major sholto's going to be murdered i don't 
know how or by whom but it's going to happen 
excuse me coming through 
consulting 
stay here please be careful 
excuse me coming through 
excuse me 
i'm sorry one more 
oops i'm so sorry 
thank you 
how can you not remember which room 
you remember everything 
i have to delete something 207 
major sholto major sholto 
major sholto if someone's about 
to make an attempt on my life 
it won't be the first time 
i'm ready 
major let us in 
kick the door down 
i really wouldn't 
i have a gun in my hand and 
a lifetime of unfortunate reflexes 
you're not safe in there whoever's after 
you we know a locked room doesn't stop him 
the invisible man 
with the invisible knife 
i don't know how he does it i can't stop him and 
that means he'll do it again solve it then 
i'm sorry 
you're the famous mr holmes 
solve the case on you go 
tell me how he did it 
and i'll open the door 
please this is no time for games 
just let us in you're in danger 
so are you 
so long as you're here 
please leave me 
despite my reputation i really 
don't approve of collateral damage 
solve it sorry solve it and 
he'll open the door like he said 
i couldn't solve it before how can i solve it now 
because it matters now 
what are you talking about get your 
wife under control she's right 
oh you've changed 
no she is shut up 
you are not a puzzle-solver 
you never have been 
you're a drama queen 
now there's a man in there about 
to die the game is on - solve it 
bainbridge 
bainbridge 
though in fairness 
he's a drama queen too i know 
major sholto no-one's 
coming to kill you 
i'm afraid you've already 
been killed several hours ago 
what did you say 
don't take off your belt 
my belt 
his belt yes 
bainbridge was stabbed 
hours before we even saw him 
but it was through his belt 
tight belt worn high on the waist 
very easy to push a small blade 
through the fabric 
and you wouldn't even feel it 
the belt would bind the flesh 
together when it was tied tight 
exactly but when you took it off 
delayed-action stabbing 
all the time in the world 
to create an alibi major sholto 
so 
i was to be killed by my uniform 
how appropriate 
he solved the case major 
you're supposed to open 
the door now a deal is a deal 
i'm not even supposed to 
have this any more 
they gave me special 
dispensation to keep it 
i couldn't imagine life 
out of this uniform 
i suppose given the circumstances 
i don't have to 
when so many want you dead 
it hardly seems 
good manners to argue 
whatever you're doing in there 
james stop it right now 
i will kick this door down 
mr holmes you and 
i are similar i think 
yes i think we are there's 
a proper time to die isn't there 
of course there is 
and one should embrace it 
when it comes 
like a soldier 
of course one should 
but not at john's wedding 
we wouldn't do that would we 
you and me 
we would never do that 
to john watson 
i'm going to break it down 
wait wait wait you won't have to 
i believe i am in need 
of medical attention 
i believe i'm your doctor 
pretty good 
just hold your nerve 
on your turning 
why do we have to rehearse 
because we are about to 
dance together in public 
and your skills are appalling 
wow you're a good teacher hmm 
and you're a brilliant dancer 
can i let you in 
on something janine 
go on then 
i love dancing 
i've always loved it 
seriously 
watch out 
oh 
never really comes up 
in crime work but you know 
i live in hope of the right case 
oh i wish you weren't 
whatever it is you are 
i know well glad to see 
you've pulled sherlock 
what with murderers 
running riot at my wedding 
one murderer one nearly murderer 
loves to exaggerate - 
you should try living with him 
sherlock 
got him for you 
ah the photographer 
excellent thank you 
may i have a look at your camera 
erm what's this about 
i was halfway home 
you should have driven faster 
ah yes yes 
very good 
now you see perfect 
what is are you going to tell us 
try looking yourself 
look for what 
is the murderer in these photographs 
it's not what's 
in the photographs 
it's what's not in them 
not in any of them 
sherlock 
the showing-off thing 
we've discussed it before 
there is always a man at a wedding 
who is not in any photograph 
who can go anywhere 
and even carry an equipment bag 
around with him if he likes 
and you never even see his face 
you only ever see 
the camera 
what are you doing what is this 
jonathan small today's 
substitute wedding photographer 
known to us as the mayfly man 
his brother was one of the raw 
recruits killed in that incursion 
johnny sought revenge on sholto 
worked his way through 
sholto's staff 
found what he needed 
an invitation to a wedding 
the one time sholto would 
have to be out in public 
so he made his plan 
and rehearsed the murder 
making sure of every last detail 
brilliant ruthless 
and almost certainly a monomaniac 
though in fairness his photographs 
are actually quite good 
everything you need is on that 
you probably ought to 
arrest him or something 
do you always carry handcuffs 
down girl come on quick 
it's not me you should 
be arresting mr holmes 
oh i don't do the arresting 
i just farm that out 
sholto he's the killer not me 
i should have killed him quicker 
i shouldn't have tried to be clever 
you should have driven faster 
right 
ladies and gentlemen 
just one last thing 
before the evening begins properly 
apologies for earlier 
a crisis arose and was dealt with 
more importantly however 
today we saw two people make vows 
i've never made a vow in my life 
and after tonight 
i never will again 
so here in front of you all 
my first and last vow 
mary and john 
whatever it takes 
whatever happens 
from now on 
i swear i will always be there 
always 
for all three of you 
erm sorry i mean 
i mean two of you 
all two of you both of you 
in fact i just miscounted 
anyway it's time for dancing 
play the music again 
please thank you 
ok everybody just dance 
don't be shy 
dancing please very good 
sorry that was one more deduction 
than i was really expecting 
deduction increased appetite 
i'm starving 
change of taste perception 
oh i chose this wine 
but it's bloody awful 
you were sick this morning 
you assumed it was 
just wedding nerves 
you got angry with me 
when i mentioned it to you 
all the signs are there the signs 
the signs of three 
what 
mary i think you should 
do a pregnancy test 
well the statistics for 
the first trimester are 
shut up 
just shut up 
sorry 
how did he notice before me 
i'm a bloody doctor it's your 
day off it's your day off 
stop stop panicking 
i'm not panicking i'm pregnant 
i'm panicking don't panic 
none of you panic 
absolutely no reason to panic 
oh and you'd know of course yes i would 
you're already the best parents in the world 
look at all the practice 
you've had what practice 
well you're hardly going to need me around 
now that you've got a real baby on the way 
are you all right yeah 
dance hmm 
both of you now go dance 
we can't just stand here people will 
wonder what we're talking about right 
well what about you 
yeah we can't all three dance there 
are limits yes there are ahem 
come on husband let's go 
this isn't a waltz is it no 
don't worry 
i have been tutoring him 
he did you know baker street behind closed curtains 
mrs hudson came in one time 
i don't know how those 
rumours started 
and taking my body under 
when she walked 
to see the light 
but now it seems so right 
a rolling ball of thunder 
and taking my body under 
just a magic trick 
no all right stop it now 
keep your eyes fixed on me 
do what 
it's what people do don't they 
leave a note when 
no don't 
sherlock 
john 
john look at me look at me 
and sleep 
right the way down right the way 
deep right the way sound asleep 
that's real 
that's good with my voice just 
there in the centre of your head 
and floating all the way around you 
and you will awaken in three 
two one 
let me come through please 
he's my friend 
no no no no it's obvious 
that's how he did it it's obvious 
derren brown 
let it go sherlock's dead 
but is he 
there was a body it was him 
it was definitely him 
molly hooper laid him out 
no she's lying 
it was jim moriarty's body 
with a mask on 
a mask 
a bungee rope a mask 
derren brown 
two years and the theories 
keep getting more stupid 
how many more have you got 
for me today 
well you know the paving slabs 
in that whole area 
even the exact ones 
that he landed on 
you know they were all guilt 
that's all this is 
you pushed us all into thinking 
that sherlock that was a fraud 
you and donovan 
you did this and it killed him 
and he's staying dead 
do you honestly believe that 
if you have enough stupid theories 
it's going to change 
what really happened 
i believe in sherlock holmes 
yeah well 
that won't bring him back 
and that after extensive 
police investigations 
richard brook did indeed prove to be 
the creation of james moriarty 
scenes there was uproar in court 
and cleared of all suspicion' 
comes too late for the detective 
two years ago' 
questions are now being asked as to 
why police let matters get so far 
sherlock holmes fell to his death 
from the top of london's bart's 
hospital although he left no note 
friends say it's unlikely 
he was able to cope with the 
well then absent friends 
sherlock 
sherlock 
and may god rest his soul 
translated from serbian: 
what 
now listen to me 
there's an underground terrorist 
network active in london 
and a massive attack is imminent 
sorry but the holiday is over 
back to baker street 
penny for the guy 
oi mate penny for the guy 
penny for the guy mate 
penny for the guy 
penny for the guy 
penny for the guy 
thing i've ever done' 
you have been busy haven't you 
quite the busy little bee hmm 
moriarty's network 
took me two years to dismantle it 
and you're confident you have 
the serbian side was the last piece 
of the puzzle 
yes you got yourself in deep there 
with baron maupertuis 
quite a scheme colossal 
anyway you're safe now 
mmm 
a small "thank you" 
wouldn't go amiss 
what for 
for wading in 
in case you've forgotten 
field work is not my natural milieu 
you sat there and watched me 
being beaten a pulp 
i got you out no i got me out 
why didn't you intervene sooner 
i couldn't risk giving 
myself away could i 
it would have ruined everything 
you were enjoying it nonsense 
definitely enjoying it 
listen do you have any idea 
what it was like sherlock 
going undercover 
smuggling my way 
into their ranks like that 
the noise the people 
i didn't know you spoke serbian 
i didn't 
but the language has a slavic root 
frequent turkish 
and german loan words 
took me a couple of hours 
hmm you're slipping 
middle-age brother mine 
comes to us all 
oh no you don't take it do you 
no you forget 
a little thing like that 
yes 
you forget lots of little things 
it seems 
uh-huh 
not sure about that 
hmm ages you 
just trying it out 
well it ages you 
look i'm not your mother 
i've no right to expect it 
no but just one phone call john 
just one phone call would have done 
i know 
after all we went through 
yes 
i am sorry 
look i understand how difficult 
it was for you after 
i just let it slide mrs hudson 
i let it all slide 
and it just got harder and harder 
to pick up the phone somehow 
do you know what i mean 
i need you to give this matter 
your full attention sherlock 
is that quite clear what do you 
think of this shirt sherlock 
i will find your underground 
terror cell mycroft 
just put me back in london 
i need to get to know the place 
again breathe it in 
feel every quiver 
of its beating heart 
one of our men died 
getting this information 
all the chatter 
all the traffic concurs 
there's going to be a terrorist 
strike on london a big one 
and what about john watson 
john mm have you seen him 
oh yes 
we meet up every friday 
for fish and chips() 
i've kept a weather eye on him 
of course 
we haven't been in touch at all 
toprepare him 
no 
well we'll have to get rid of that 
i can't be seen to be wandering 
around with an old man 
i couldn't face letting it out 
he never liked me dusting 
no i know 
so why now what changed your mind 
well i've got some news 
oh god is it serious 
what no no i'm not ill 
i've well i'm 
you're emigrating 
nope er no i've er 
oh ah lovely 
yeah we're getting married 
well i'm going to ask anyway 
so soon after sherlock 
hmm well yes 
what's his name 
it's a woman 
a woman yes of course 
it's a woman 
you really have moved on haven't 
you mrs hudson how many times 
sherlock was not my boyfriend 
live and let live that's my motto 
listen to me - i am not gay 
i think i'll surprise john 
he'll be delighted 
you think so 
mm pop into baker street 
who knows jump out of a cake 
baker street 
he isn't there any more 
why would he be 
it's been two years 
he's got on with his life 
what life i've been away 
where's he going to be tonight 
how would i know you always know 
he has a dinner reservation 
in the marylebone road 
nice little spot 
they have a few bottles 
of the 2000 saint-emilion 
though i prefer the 2001 
i think maybe i'll just drop by 
you know it is just possible 
that you won't be welcome 
no it isn't 
now where is it 
where's what you know what 
welcome back mr holmes 
thank you 
blud 
sir can i help you 
your wife just texted you possibly 
her contractions have started 
excuse me sir 
oh sir i am so so sorry 
er please let me just go to the 
kitchen and dry that off for you 
finished with that sir 
allow me to take it for you 
madam can i suggest you look at this 
menu it's completely identical 
can i 
help you with anything sir 
hi yeah i'm looking for a bottle 
of champagne a good one 
hmm well these are all 
excellent vintages sir 
oh it's not really my area 
what do you suggest 
well you cannot possibly go wrong 
but if you'd like my personal 
recommendation hmm 
this last one on the list 
is a favourite of mine 
it is you might in fact say 
like a face from the past 
great i'll have that one please 
it is familiar 
but with the quality of surprise 
well surprise me 
i'm certainly endeavouring to sir 
sorry that took so long 
you ok 
yeah yeah me fine i am fine 
now then what did you 
want to ask me 
more wine no i'm good with water 
thanks right 
so 
er so 
mary 
listen um 
i know it hasn't been long 
and i know we haven't known 
each other for a long time 
go on yes i will 
as you know these last couple 
of years haven't been easy for me 
and meeting you 
yeah meeting you has been 
the best thing 
that could have possibly 
happened i agree what 
i agree i'm the best thing 
that could have happened to you 
sorry 
well no it's um 
so 
could you see your way um 
if you could see your way to 
sir you'll find this vintage 
exceptionally to your liking 
it has all the qualities of the old 
with the colour of the new 
no sorry not now please like 
a gaze from a crowd of strangers 
suddenly one is aware of staring 
into the face of an old friend 
no look seriously 
could you just 
interesting thing a tuxedo 
lends distinction to friends 
and anonymity to waiters 
john 
john what is it what 
well the short version 
bit mean springing it on you 
like that i know 
could have given you a heart attack 
probably still will 
but in my defence it was very funny 
ok it's not a great defence 
oh no you're oh yes 
oh my god 
not quite you died 
you jumped off a roof 
no you're dead 
no i'm quite sure i checked 
excuse me 
doesdoes yours rub off too 
oh my god oh my god 
do you have any idea 
what you've done 
ok john i'm suddenly realising 
i probably owe you 
some sort of an apology 
all right just john just keep 
two years 
two years hmm 
i thought 
i thought 
hmm 
now you let me grieve hmm 
how could you do that 
how 
wait before you do anything 
that you might regret um 
one question just let me 
ask one question 
are you really going to keep that 
i calculated that there were 
once i'd invited moriarty 
onto the roof 
if at all possible 
into a parked van filled with washing bags 
secondly a system of japanese wrestling 
you can be remarkably thick' 
what i don't care how 
you faked it sherlock 
i want to know why 
why because moriarty 
had to be stopped 
oh 
why as in 
i see yes why 
that's a little more difficult 
to explain 
i've got all night 
actually um that was 
mostly mycroft's idea 
oh so it was your brother's plan 
oh but he would have needed 
a confidante 
mm-hm 
sorry 
but he was the only one 
the only one who knew 
a couple of others it was a very 
elaborate plan it had to be 
the next of the 13 possibilities 
was who else 
who else knew 
who molly 
molly john molly hooper 
and some of my homeless network 
and that's all ok 
ok 
so just your brother 
molly hooper and 100 tramps 
ha no 25 at most 
seriously it's not a joke 
you're really keeping this 
er yeah 
sure 
mary likes it 
hmm no she doesn't 
she does she doesn't 
oh don't 
oh brilliant() 
look i'm sorry i'm sorry 
i didn't know how to tell you 
right no no this is charming 
i've really missed this() 
one word sherlock 
that is all i would have needed 
one word to let me know 
that you were alive 
i've nearly been in contact so 
many times but john scoffs 
i worried that you know you might 
say something indiscreet what 
you know let the cat out of the bag 
so this is my fault 
oh god why am i the only one 
who thinks that this is wrong 
the only one reacting 
like a human being 
over-reacting over-reacting 
john over-reacting so you fake 
your own death and you waltz in here 
large as bloody life shh but i'm 
not meant to have a problem with it 
cos sherlock holmes thinks it's 
a perfectly ok thing to do 
shut up i don't want everyone 
knowing i'm still alive 
oh so it's still a secret is it 
yes it's still a secret 
promise you won't tell anyone 
swear to god 
london is in danger john there's an imminent 
terrorist attack and i need your help 
my help 
you have missed this admit it 
the thrill of the chase 
the blood pumping through your veins 
just the two of us 
against the rest of the world 
i don't understand 
i said i'm sorry 
isn't that what you're supposed 
to do 
gosh you don't know anything 
about human nature do you 
hmm nature no 
human no 
i'll talk him round 
you will 
oh yeah 
mary 
can you believe his nerve 
i like him 
what 
i like him 
those things will kill you 
oh you bastard 
it's time to come back 
you've been letting things 
slide graham 
greg 
greg 
with an anti terrorism bill' 
with all due exped' 
where are you 
what's going on' 
please will you do this for me 
please 
do what 
it's my note 
don't they' 
leave a note 
goodbye john 'no' 
sherlock 
oh ho 
what are you out of your mind 
i don't see why not 
it's just as plausible 
as some of your theories 
look if you're not going to take it 
seriously laura 
i do take it seriously 
i don't think we should wear hats 
i founded 'the empty hearse' 
so like-minded people could meet 
discuss theories 
sherlock's still out there 
i'm convinced of it 
oh my god 
ohmygod 
picking out a scent" 
you what "i couldn't help thinking 
what an amazing criminal he'd make 
against the law" don't read that 
famous blog finally 
come on that's 
ancient history yes i know but it's 
not though is it because he's 
what are you doing 
having a wash 
you're shaving it off 
well you hate it 
sherlock hates it 
apparently everyone hates it oh 
are you going to see him again 
no i'm going to work 
oh and after work are you going 
to see him again no 
god i had six months 
of bristly kisses for me 
and then his nibs turns up 
i don't shave for sherlock holmes 
you should put that on a t-shirt 
shut up or what 
or i'll marry you 
london it's like a great cesspool 
into which all kinds 
of criminals agents and 
drifters are irresistibly drained 
sometimes it's not a question of 
who it's a question of who knows 
if this man cancels his papers 
i need to know 
if this woman leaves london without 
putting her dog into kennels 
i need to know 
i have certain people 
they are markers 
if they start to move 
i'll know something's up 
like rats deserting a sinking ship 
all very interesting sherlock 
but the terror alert has been 
raised to critical 
boring your move 
we have solid information 
an attack is coming 
solid information a secret terrorist 
organisation is planning an attack 
that's what secret terrorist organisations do isn't it 
it's their version of golf 
an agent gave his life 
to tell us that oh well 
perhaps he shouldn't have done he was 
obviously just trying to show off 
none of these 'markers' of yours 
is behaving in any way suspiciously 
your move 
no mycroft but you have 
to trust me i'll find the answer 
but it'll be in an odd phrase 
in an on-line blog 
or an unexpected trip 
to the countryside 
or a misplaced lonely hearts ad 
your move 
i've given the prime minister my 
personal assurance you're on the case 
i am on the case we both are 
look at us right now 
oh bugger whoopsy 
can't handle a broken heart 
how very telling 
don't be smart 
that takes me back 
i'm the smart one" 
i am the smart one 
i used to think i was an idiot 
both of us thought you were 
an idiot sherlock 
we had nothing else to go on 
until we met other children 
oh yes that was a mistake 
ghastly what were they thinking of 
probably something about 
trying to make friends 
oh yes friends 
of course you go in 
for that sort of thing now 
and you don't ever 
if you seem slow to me sherlock 
can you imagine what real people 
are like 
i'm living in a world of goldfish 
yes but i've been away 
for two years 
so oh i don't know 
i thought perhaps you might have 
found yourself a 
goldfish change the subject now 
rest assured mycroft 
whatever this underground 
network of yours is up to 
the secret will reside in something 
seemingly insignificant or bizarre 
ooh-ooh speaking of which 
i can't believe it 
i just can't believe it 
him sitting in his chair again 
oh isn't it wonderful mr holmes 
i can barely contain myself() 
oh he really can you know 
he's secretly pleased to see you 
underneath all that 
sorry which of us 
both of you 
let's play something different 
why are we playing games 
london's terror alert has been 
raised to critical 
i'm just passing the time 
let's do deductions 
client left this while i was out 
what do you reckon 
i'm busy 
oh go on it's been an age 
i always win 
which is why you can't resist 
i find nothing irresistible in the 
hat of a well-travelled anxious 
sentimental unfit creature of habit 
with appalling halitosis 
damn 
isolated too don't you think 
why would he be isolated 
why size of the hat 
don't be silly 
some women have large heads too 
no he's recently had his hair cut 
you can see the little hairs adhering 
to the perspiration stains on the inside 
some women have short hair too 
balance of probability not that you've ever spoken 
to a woman with short hair or you know a woman 
stains show he's out of condition 
he's sentimental cos the hat 
has been repaired three four 
five times very neatly 
the cost of the repairs exceeds that of the hat 
he's mawkishly attached to it more than that 
one or two patches would indicate sentimentality 
five's obsessive behaviour obsessive compulsive 
hardly your client left it behind 
what sort of an obsessive compulsive 
would do that 
the earlier patches are extensively 
sun bleached 
so he's worn it abroad in peru 
peru this is a chullo 
the classic headgear of andes 
it's made of alpaca 
no no icelandic sheep wool 
similar but very distinctive 
if you know what you're looking for 
i've written a blog on the varying 
tensile strengths of different 
natural fibres 
i'm sure there's a crying 
need for that() 
you said he was anxious the bobble on 
the left side has been badly chewed 
which shows he's a man of a nervous 
disposition but 
but also a creature of habit 
cos he hasn't chewed 
the bobble on the right precisely 
a sniff of the offending bobble tells us all 
we need to know about the state of his breath 
brilliant elementary 
but you've missed his isolation 
i don't see it 
plain as day where 
there for all to see tell me 
plain as the nose on your tell me 
well anybody who wears 
a hat as stupid as this 
isn't in the habit of hanging 
around other people is he 
not at all maybe he just 
doesn't mind being different 
he doesn't necessarily 
have to be isolated 
exactly 
i'm sorry 
he's different so what 
why would he mind 
you're quite right 
why would anyone mind 
i am not lonely sherlock 
how would you know 
yes back to work 
if you don't mind good morning 
right back to work 
mr summerson 
right undescended testicle 
right 
sherlock 
hmm 
talk to john 
i've tried talking to him 
he made his position quite clear 
just relax mr summerson 
what did he say 
f 
cough 
oh dear 
hi 
right 
you wanted to see me 
yes molly 
yes would you 
would you like to 
have dinner solve crimes 
um 
absolutely nothing to be ashamed of 
mrs reeves 
it's very common 
but i'm recommending a course of 
monkey glands 
but enough about professor presbury 
tell us more about your case mr harcourt 
you sure about this absolutely 
should i be making notes if it makes you feel better 
that's what john says he does 
so if i'm being john you're not 
being john you're being yourself 
well absolutely no one should have 
been able to empty 
that bank account other than myself 
and helen 
why didn't you assume it was your wife 
because i've always had total faith in her 
no it's because you emptied it 
weight-loss hair dye botox affair 
lawyer next 
this is mr blake piles 
mr blake hi 
and your pen-pal's emails 
just stopped did they 
and you really thought 
he was the one didn't you 
the love of your life 
stepfather posing as on-line 
boyfriend 
what 
breaks it off breaks her heart 
she swears off relationships 
stays at home 
he still has her wage coming in 
mr windibank you have been 
a complete and utter 
piss pot 
it's nothing to worry about just a 
small infection by the sound of it 
dr verner is your usual gp yes 
yeah yeah yeah 
he looked after me man and boy 
i run a little shop 
just on the corner of church street 
oh magazines and dvds 
i've brought along a few little 
beauties that might interest you 
tree worshippers oh that's 
a corker it's very saucy 
and british birds 
same sort of thing 
i'm fine thanks 
the holy war 
sounds a bit dry i know 
but there's a nun with all these 
holes in her habit 
jesus sherlock 
what what do you want 
uh 
have you come to torment me what are you talking about 
what do you think i'm going 
to be fooled by this bloody beard 
you're crazy no no no no no 
it's not as good as your french 
not as good as your french 
it's not even a good disguise 
sherlock 
where did you get it from 
a bloody joke shop 
oh my god 
i i am so sorry 
oh my god 
please 
it's fine 
this one's got us all baffled 
hmm i don't doubt it 
what is it 
you're onto something aren't you 
maybe 
shut up john 
what hmm 
nothing 
hello hmm 
are you sure i'm sure ok 
i'm late for cath 
i'll see you later 
bye bye 
this going to be 
your new arrangement is it 
just giving it a go 
right 
so john 
not really in the picture any more 
trains 
trains 
male 40 to 50 
oh sorry did you want to be 
er no please be my guest 
shut up 
it doesn't make sense 
what doesn't 
this skeleton 
it can't be any more than 
six months old 
wow 
uh-huh that's impossible 
welcome to my world 
i won't insult your intelligence 
by explaining it to you 
no please insult away 
the corpse is is six months old 
it's dressed in a shoddy victorian 
outfit from a museum 
it's been displayed on a dummy 
for many years 
in a case facing south-east judging 
from the fading of the fabric 
it was sold off in a fire damage sale 
a week ago 
so the whole thing was a fake 
yes 
looked so promising 
facile 
why would someone go to all 
that trouble 
why indeed john 
mind the gap' 
oh thanks for hanging onto it 
no problem 
so what's this all about 
mr shilcott 
my girlfriend's a big fan of yours 
girlfriend 
sorry do go on 
i like trains 
yes i work on the tube on the 
district line and part of my job 
is to wipe the security footage 
after it's been cleared 
i was just whizzing through 
and i found something a bit bizarre 
now this was a week ago 
the last train on the friday night 
westminster station 
now this man gets into 
the last car 
car they're cars not carriages 
it's a legacy of the early american 
involvement in the tube system 
he said he liked trains 
and the next stop 
st james' park station 
and 
i thought you'd like it 
he gets into the last car 
at westminster the only passenger 
and the car is empty 
at st james's park station 
explain that mr holmes 
couldn't he have just jumped off there's a 
safety mechanism that prevents the doors 
from opening in transit 
but there's something else 
the driver of that train 
hasn't been to work since 
according to his flatmate he's 
on holiday came into some money 
bought off 
hmm 
so if the driver of the train 
was in on it 
then the passenger did get off 
there's nowhere he could go it's a straight run 
on the district line between the two stations 
there's no side tunnels 
no maintenance tunnels 
nothing on any map nothing 
train never stops 
and a man vanishes 
good innit 
i know that face 
excuse you() 
the journey between those stations 
usually takes five minutes 
and that one took ten ten minutes to get 
from westminster to st james's park 
i'll need maps lots of maps 
older maps all the maps right 
fancy some chips what 
i know a fantastic fish shop 
just off the marylebone road 
the owner always gives me 
extra portions 
did you get him off a murder charge 
no i helped him 
put up some shelves 
sherlock hmm 
what was today about 
saying thank you 
for what 
for everything you did for me 
it's ok it's my pleasure 
no i mean it 
i don't mean pleasure 
i mean i didn't mind 
i wanted to moriarty slipped up 
he made a mistake 
because the one person he thought 
didn't matter at all to me 
was the one person 
that mattered the most 
you made it all possible 
but you can't do this again 
can you 
i've had a lovely day 
i'd love to i just um 
hmm congratulations by the way 
he's not from work 
we met through friends 
old-fashioned way 
he's nice we've got a dog 
we we go to the pub on weekends 
and i've met his mum and dad 
and his friends and all his family 
i've no idea why i'm telling 
you any of this 
i hope you'll be very happy 
molly hooper 
you deserve it 
after all not all the men you fall 
for can turn out to be sociopaths 
no no 
maybe it's just my type 
oh mrs hudson sorry i think 
someone's got john john watson 
hang on who are you 
oh i'm his fiancee 
oh mary

it's a skip code 
first word then every third 
now

did you drive here er yes 
it's too slow it's too slow

i don't know 
damn

john 
john john 
hey john 
i'd put it at all silly woman' 
anyway it was then that 
i first noticed it was missing 
i said "have you checked 
down the back of the sofa" 
he's always losing things down the 
back of the sofa aren't you dear 
afraid so 
oh keys small change sweeties 
especially his glasses glasses 
blooming things i said 
and he says "what 
like larry grayson" larry grayson 
so did you find it eventually 
your lottery ticket 
well yes thank goodness 
we caught the coach on time 
after all 
we managed to see st paul's 
the tower 
but they weren't letting 
anyone into parliament 
some big debate going on 
john sorry you're busy 
no no no they were just leaving 
no oh were we yes 
no no if you've got a case 
no not a case yeah go we're here till 
saturday remember yes wonderful just get out 
yes well give us a ring 
very nice yes good get out 
i can't tell you how glad 
we are sherlock 
all that time people 
thinking the worst 
we're just so pleased it's all over 
ring up more often won't you 
mm-hm she worries 
promise 
promise 
oh for god 
sorry about that no it's fine 
clients 
just my parents 
your parents 
in town for a few days 
your parents mycroft promised to 
take them to a matinee of les mis 
tried to talk me into doing it 
those were your parents yes 
well 
what 
i mean they're just so 
it's a cross i have to bear 
did they know too 
hmm that you spent the last 
two years playing hide and seek 
maybe ah so that's why 
they weren't at the funeral 
sorry sorry again hmm 
sorry 
so you've shaved it off then 
yeah wasn't working for me 
yeah i'm glad you didn't like it 
no i prefer my doctors 
clean-shaven 
that's not a sentence 
you hear every day 
how are you feeling 
yeah not bad bit smoked 
right 
last night who did that 
and why did they target me 
i don't know 
is it someone trying 
to get to you through me 
is it something to do with this 
terrorist thing you talked about 
i don't know i can't see 
the pattern it's too nebulous 
why would an agent give his life to tell us something 
incredibly insignificant that's what's strange 
give his life 
according to mycroft 
there's an underground network planning 
an attack on london that's all we know 
these are my rats john rats 
my markers agents lowlifes 
people who might find themselves 
arrested or their diplomatic 
immunity suddenly rescinded 
if one of them starts acting 
suspiciously we know something's up 
five of them are behaving perfectly 
normally but the sixth 
i know him don't i 
lord moran peer of the realm 
minister for overseas development 
pillar of the establishment yes 
he's been working for north korea 
since 1996 
what he's the big rat 
rat number one 
he's just done something 
very suspicious indeed 
yeah that's odd 
there's nowhere 
he could have got off 
not according to the maps 
there's something something 
something i'm missing 
something staring me in the face 
any idea who they are 
this underground network 
intelligence must have a list 
of the most obvious ones 
our rat's just come out of his den 
al-qaeda the ira have been getting 
restless again 
maybe they're going to make an 
appearance yes yes yes yes 
i've been an idiot a blind idiot 
what oh that's good 
that could be brilliant 
what are you on about mycroft's 
intelligence is not nebulous at all 
it's specific incredibly specific 
what do you mean 
it's not an underground network 
john it's an underground network 
right 
what sometimes a deception 
is so audacious so outrageous 
that you can't see it even when 
it's staring you in the face look 
seven carriages 
leave westminster mm 
and only six carriages 
arrive at st james's park 
ah but that's i mean 
it's impossible 
moran didn't disappear 
the entire tube compartment did 
the driver must have diverted the train 
and then detached the last carriage 
detached it where you said there 
was nothing between those stations 
not on the maps but once 
you eliminate the other factors 
the remaining thing must be the truth that 
carriage vanished so it must be somewhere 
but why though 
why detach it in the first place 
it vanishes between st james's park 
and westminster 
lord moran vanishes 
you're kidnapped and nearly burnt 
to death at a fireworks party 
what's the date john today's date 
hmm november the 
oh god 
lord moran 
he's a peer of the realm 
normally he'd sit in the house 
tonight there's an all-night sitting 
to vote on the new anti-terrorism bill 
but he won't be there not tonight 
not the 5th november 
mr holmes i told you 
there has to be check again 
this whole area is a big mess 
of old and new stuff 
charing cross is made up 
of bits of older stations 
like trafalgar square strand 
no it's none of those 
we've accounted for those 
st margaret street bridge street 
sumatra road parliament street 
mr holmes there is something 
well why isn't it on the maps 
before it ever opened' what 
staircases but it all got tied up 
built the station on the surface' 
it's right underneath 
the palace of westminster 
so what's down there a bomb 
oh 
will be too close to call 
into the chamber for what 
important vote of this parliament" 
exactly are we protecting 
own people 
on a scale unprecedented' 
there's a bomb then the tube 
carriage is carrying a bomb 
must be right 
what are you doing 
i'm calling the police what no 
sherlock this isn't a game 
they need to evacuate parliament 
they'll get in the way they always 
do this is cleaner more efficient 
and illegal 
a bit 
what are you doing 
coming 
i don't understand 
well that's a first 
there's nowhere else it could be 
oh 
what 
hang on sherlock 
what that's isn't it live 
perfectly safe as long as we avoid 
touching the rails 
of course yeah 
avoid the rails great 
this way 
are you sure sure 
ha 
look at that 
john hmm 
demolition charges 
it's empty there's nothing 
isn't there 
this is the bomb 
what 
it's not carrying explosives 
the whole compartment is the bomb 
we need bomb disposal 
there may not be time for that now 
so what do we do 
i have no idea 
well think of something 
why do you think i know what to do 
cos you're sherlock holmes 
you're as clever as it gets 
it doesn't mean i know how 
to diffuse a giant bomb 
what about you i wasn't in bomb 
disposal i'm a bloody doctor 
and a soldier 
as you keep reminding us all 
can't can't we rip 
the timer off or something 
that would set it off 
you see you know things 
oh 
er my god 
er 
why didn't you call the police 
can you just why do you 
never call the police 
well it's no use now 
so you can't switch the bomb off 
you can't switch the bomb off 
and you didn't call the police 
go john go now 
there's no point now is there 
because there's not enough time 
to get away and if we don't do this 
other people will die 
mind palace 
hmm use your mind palace 
how will that help 
you've salted away 
every fact under the sun 
and you think i've just got "how to defuse a 
bomb" tucked away in there somewhere yes 
maybe 
think 
think please think 
think 
i can't 
oh my god 
this is it 
um er 
oh my god 
turn that off oh god 
er um er 
i'm sorry 
what 
i can't i can't do it john 
i don't know how 
forgive me 
what 
please john forgive me 
for all the hurt that i caused you 
no no no no no no 
this is a trick no 
another one of your bloody tricks 
no you're just trying 
to make me say something nice 
not this time 
it's just to make you look good 
even though you've behaved like 
i wanted you not to be dead 
yeah well be careful 
what you wish for 
if i hadn't come back 
you wouldn't be standing there and 
with mary 
yeah i know 
look i find it difficult i find 
it difficult this sort of stuff 
i know 
you were the best and the wisest man 
that i have ever known 
yes of course i forgive you 
the criminal network moriarty 
headed was vast 
its roots were everywhere like a 
cancer so we came up with a plan 
mycroft fed moriarty 
information about me 
moriarty in turn gave us hints 
just hints as to the extent 
of his web 
we let him go because it was 
important to let him believe 
he had the upper hand 
and then i sat back 
and watched moriarty 
destroy my reputation bit by bit 
i had to make him 
believe he'd beaten me 
utterly defeated me 
and then he'd show his hand 
there were 13 likely scenarios 
once we were up on that roof 
each of them were rigorously worked 
out and given a code name 
it wasn't just my reputation 
that moriarty needed to bury 
i had to die 
sherlock 
you can have me arrested 
you can torture me 
you can do anything you like 
with me 
but nothing's going to prevent them 
from pulling the trigger 
your only three friends 
in the world will die unless 
unless i kill myself 
and complete your story 
you've got to admit that's sexier 
anticipate was just how far 
i suppose that was obvious 
at the swimming pool 
argh 
set the wheels in motion 
all right 
keep your eyes fixed on me 
please will you do this for me 
just where i'd put him 
by the ambulance station' 
sherlock 
out of the way 
went one way john went the other 
with the corpse on the pavement 
a squash ball under the armpit 
momentarily cuts off the pulse' 
let me come through please 
it's all right 
no he's my friend 
it's all right 
no he's my friend 
it's all right it's all right 
he's my friend please 
everything was anticipated 
every eventuality allowed for 
it worked perfectly 
molly molly hooper 
she was in on it 
yes you remember the little girl 
who was abducted by moriarty 
get out 
because i was her kidnapper' 
but i deduced moriarty must have 
found someone who looked 
very like me to plant suspicion 
and that that man whoever he was 
had to be got out of the way 
as soon as his usefulness ended 
that meant there was a corpse 
in the morgue somewhere 
that looked just like me 
clever 
molly found the body 
faked the records 
and i provided the other coat 
i've got lots of coats 
what about the sniper 
aiming at john 
mycroft's men intervened before 
he could take the shot 
he was invited to reconsider 
is it done 
good 
and your homeless network 
as i explained 
the whole street was closed off 
like a scene from a play 
neat don't you think 
hmm 
what 
not the way i'd have done it 
oh really 
no i'm not saying 
it's not clever but what 
bitdisappointed 
oh everyone's a critic 
anyway that's not why i came 
no no i think you know 
why i'm here phillip 
didn't you think it was intriguing 
lurid a case so sensational 
you hoped i'd be interested 
but you overdid it phillip 
you and your little fan-club 
i just couldn't live with myself 
knowing that i'd driven you to 
but you didn't you were 
always right i wasn't dead 
no no and everything's ok now 
isn't it 
yeah yeah 
though of course you've 
wasted police time 
perverted the course of justice 
risked distracting me from a massive 
terrorist assault that could have 
both destroyed parliament and caused 
the death of hundreds of people 
oh god oh god i'm sorry 
sherlock 
i'm so sorry 
hang on 
that doesn't make sense 
how could you be sure john 
would stand on that exact spot 
i mean what if he'd moved 
andhow did you 
do it all so quickly 
what if the bike hadn't hit him 
and anyway 
why are you telling me all this 
if you'd pulled that off i'm the 
last person you'd tell the truth to 
sherlock holmes 
you 
oh your face 
you 
totally had you 
you cock 
i knew it i knew it you oh those 
things you said such sweet things 
i never knew you cared i will i'll kill 
you if you ever breathe a word of this 
scout's honour 
you knew how to turn it off 
there's an off switch 
there's always an off switch 
terrorists can get into 
all sorts of problems 
unless there's an off switch 
so why did you let me go through 
all that i didn't lie altogether 
i've absolutely no idea how to turn 
any of these silly little lights off 
and you did call the police 
of course i called the police 
i'm definitely going to kill you 
oh please killing me 
that's so two years ago 
i beg of you 
oh i'm sorry brother dear 
but you made a promise 
nothing i can do to help 
the pain of it the horror' 
come on you'll have to go down 
they want the story 
in a minute 
i'm really pleased mary 
have you set a date 
well we thought may 
ah a spring wedding yeah 
well once we've 
actually got engaged yeah 
we were interrupted last time 
yeah well i can't wait 
you will be there sherlock 
weddings not really my thing 
hello everyone hello molly

so um

yeah i've moved on 
did you 
i'm not saying a word no best not 
but i'm still waiting hmm 
why did they try and kill me 
if they knew you were onto them 
why come after me 
put me in a bonfire 
i don't know 
i don't like not knowing 
unlike the nicely embellished 
fictions on your blog john 
real life is rarely so neat 
i don't know who was behind 
all this but i will find out 
i promise you 
don't pretend 
you're not enjoying this 
hmm 
being back being a hero again 
don't be stupid you'd have 
to be an idiot not to see it 
you love it love what 
being sherlock holmes 
i don't even know what 
that's supposed to mean 
sherlock you are going to tell me 
how you did it 
how you jumped off 
that building and survived 
you know my methods john 
i am known to be indestructible 
no but seriously 
when you were dead 
i went to your grave 
i should hope so 
i made a little speech 
i actually spoke to you 
i know i was there 
i asked you for one more miracle 
i asked you to stop being dead 
i heard you 
anyway time to go 
and be sherlock holmes
