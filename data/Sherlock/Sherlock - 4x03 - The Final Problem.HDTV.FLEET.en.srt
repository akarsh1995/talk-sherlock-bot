1
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,420
Mummy?

2
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,579
Mummy! Wake up! Wake up!

3
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,580
Mummy!

4
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,819
Wake up!

5
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:28,419
Help me, please! I'm on a plane
and everyone's asleep! Help me!

6
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,184
'Hello. My name's Jim Moriarty.

7
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:35,333
'Welcome to the final problem.'

9
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,899
- 'You know, I could arrest you.
- What for?

10
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,859
- 'Wearing a dress like that.
- Would you like me to take it off?

11
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,739
- 'Then I'd really have to press charges.
- Press away.

12
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,379
'Isn't that how they got started?

13
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,393
- 'Who?
- Adam and Eve.

14
00:02:20,418 --> 00:02:22,259
- Oh, them.
- And that turned out OK.

15
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,939
'You think so?

16
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,859
'I thought it was supposed to be
the beginning of all human misery.

17
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,499
'Now, what was all
that about arresting me?

18
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,579
- 'Well, maybe not arresting you.
- No?

19
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,779
'I could just keep
you under close watch.

20
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,060
- 'Very close?
- A-huh.

21
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:42,635
'Shame, I was looking forward to putting
myself into the hands of the authorities.

22
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:43,699
'You were?

23
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:48,820
'Finger-printing, being
searched... thoroughly.'

24
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,019
Mycroft?

25
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,460
Mycroft?

26
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,219
Why don't you come
out and show yourself?

27
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,888
I don't have time for this.

28
00:04:18,913 --> 00:04:21,330
We have time, Mycroft.

29
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:23,299
All the time in the world.

30
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:33,740
Mycroft?

31
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:38,155
Who are you?

32
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,700
You know.

33
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,499
Impossible.

34
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,179
Nothing's impossible.

35
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,580
You of all people know that.

36
00:04:53,603 --> 00:04:56,087
It's coming to get you.

37
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,579
There's an east wind coming,
Mycroft. Coming to get you.

38
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,620
You can't have got out! You can't!

39
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:37,115
No use, Mycroft. There's no
defence and nowhere to hide.

40
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,380
Y-a-a-a-argh!

41
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:59,419
Sherlock? Help me!

42
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:08,179
Experiment complete.
Conclusion, I have a sister.

43
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,459
This was you? All of this was you?!

44
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,259
Conclusion two, my
sister, Eurus, apparently,

45
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,859
has been incarcerated from an
early age in a secure institution

46
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,659
controlled by my brother.
Hey, Bro!

47
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,859
Why would you do this,
this pantomime? Why?!

48
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,099
Conclusion three, you
are terrified of her.

49
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,219
You have no idea what you're
dealing with. None at all!

50
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,259
New information, she's out.

51
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,819
That's not possible.

52
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,819
It's more than possible,
she was John's therapist.

53
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:37,659
- Shot me during a session.
- Only with a tranquilliser.

54
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,539
- Hm. We still had ten minutes to go.
- Well, we'll see about a refund.

55
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:42,859
Right, you two, Wiggins has
got your money by the gate,

56
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,339
don't spend it all in one crack den.

57
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,259
Oh, I hope we didn't spoil
your enjoyment of the movie.

58
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,299
You're just leaving?!

59
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,819
Well, we're not staying here,
Eurus is coming and, er...

60
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:54,059
someone's disabled all your security.

61
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,460
Sleep well!

62
00:06:56,594 --> 00:07:00,099
Dr Watson, why would he do
that to me? That was insane!

63
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,139
Er... yes, well, someone convinced
him that you wouldn't tell the truth

64
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,259
unless you were actually
wetting yourself.

65
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,899
Someone?

66
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,179
Probably me.

67
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,379
So, that's it, is it?
You're just going?

68
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,619
Well, don't worry, there's
a place for people like you,

69
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,619
the desperate, the terrified.

70
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,779
The ones with nowhere else to run.

71
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,219
What place?

72
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,948
221B Baker Street.

73
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,699
See you in the morning. If
there's a queue, join it.

74
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,059
For God's sake, this is
not one of your idiot cases!

75
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,779
You might want to close that window.

76
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:34,420
There is an east wind coming.

77
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,979
You have to sit in the chair.

78
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,219
They won't talk to you unless you
sit in the chair, it's the rules.

79
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,420
- I'm not a client!
- Then get out.

80
00:08:07,997 --> 00:08:10,117
She's not going to stay there, is she?

81
00:08:13,313 --> 00:08:15,459
- Would you like a cup of tea?
- Thank you.

82
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,900
The kettle's over there.

83
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:22,499
So, what happens now? Are
you going to make deductions?

84
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,259
You're going to tell the
truth, Mycroft. Pure and simple.

85
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,179
Who was it said, "The truth is
rarely pure and never simple"?

86
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,979
I don't know and I don't care.

87
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,699
So, there were three
of us, I know that now.

88
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,220
You, me and Eurus.

89
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,438
A sister I can't remember.

90
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:47,979
Interesting name, Eurus.
It's Greek, isn't it?

91
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:51,659
Hm. Yeah, literally,
the God of the East Wind.

92
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,179
Yes.

93
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,819
"The east wind is coming, Sherlock."

94
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,939
You used that to scare me.

95
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,966
- No.
- You turned my sister

96
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:01,739
into a ghost story.

97
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,499
Of course I didn't. I monitored you.

98
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,980
You what?

99
00:09:07,064 --> 00:09:09,139
Memories can resurface.

100
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,139
Wounds can reopen.

101
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:14,396
The roads we walk have demons beneath.

102
00:09:15,849 --> 00:09:18,900
And yours have been waiting
for a very long time.

103
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:23,019
I never bullied you. I
used, at discreet intervals,

104
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,419
potential trigger words

105
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,019
to update myself as to
your mental condition.

106
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,299
I was looking after you.

107
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,041
Why can't I remember her?

108
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,499
- This is a private matter.
- John stays.

109
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,167
- This is family!
- That's why he stays!

110
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:49,139
So there were three Holmes kids.
What was the age gap?

111
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,019
Seven years between myself and Sherlock,

112
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,179
one year between Sherlock and Eurus.

113
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:54,900
Middle child. Explains a lot.

114
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,459
- So, did she have it, too?
- Have what?

115
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,059
The deduction thing.

116
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,780
The deduction thing?

117
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,620
Yes. More than you can know.

118
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,299
Enlighten me.

119
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,739
- You realise I'm the smart one?
- As you never cease to announce.

120
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,939
But Eurus, she was
incandescent, even then.

121
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,979
Our abilities were professionally
assessed more than once.

122
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,939
I was remarkable,

123
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:26,659
but Eurus was described
as an era-defining genius.

124
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,619
Beyond Newton.

125
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,859
Then why don't I remember her?

126
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,459
You do remember her, in a way.

127
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,339
Every choice you ever made,
every path you've ever taken,

128
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,351
the man you are today...

129
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,961
...is your memory of Eurus.

130
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:48,979
She was different from the beginning.

131
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:51,700
She knew things she
should never have known.

132
00:10:54,146 --> 00:10:57,498
As if she was somehow aware of
truths beyond the normal scope.

133
00:11:01,131 --> 00:11:02,740
You look funny grown-up.

134
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,460
- What's wrong?
- Sorry.

135
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,819
The memories are disturbing.

136
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,339
What do you mean? Examples.

137
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,139
They found her with a knife once.
She seemed to be cutting herself.

138
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,739
Mother and Father were terrified.

139
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,859
They thought it was a suicide attempt.

140
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:23,939
But when I asked Eurus what
she was doing, she said:

141
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,299
I wanted to see how my muscles worked.

142
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,273
- Jesus!
- So I asked her if

143
00:11:29,298 --> 00:11:31,739
she felt pain, and she said:

144
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,699
Which one's pain?

145
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,500
Then what happened?

146
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,580
Musgrave.

147
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:47,459
The ancestral home, where
there was always honey for tea.

148
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,874
And Sherlock played among the

149
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,779
- funny gravestones.
- Funny how?

150
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,499
Come on, you lot!

151
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,379
They weren't real. The
dates were all wrong.

152
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,569
An architectural joke
which fascinated Sherlock.

153
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,779
- Help succour me now the...
- East winds blow.

154
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,819
16 by six.

155
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,899
And under we go.

156
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,740
You're starting to remember.
Fragments.

157
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,820
Redbeard? Redbeard?

158
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:29,139
- Redbeard?
- He was my dog.

159
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,179
Eurus took Redbeard and locked him
up somewhere no-one could find him.

160
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,820
- Redbeard?
- And she refused to say where he was.

161
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,875
Redbeard?

162
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,339
She'd only repeat that song.

163
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,979
Her little ritual.

164
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,059
We begged and begged
her to tell us where he was.

165
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,859
The song is the answer.

166
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,059
But the song made no sense.

167
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,539
- What happened to Redbeard?
- We never found him.

168
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,219
But she started calling
him Drowned Redbeard,

169
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,900
so we made our assumptions.

170
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,419
Sherlock was traumatised.

171
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:15,539
Natural, I suppose. He was, in
the early days, an emotional child.

172
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:18,739
But after that, he was
different. So changed.

173
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,699
Never spoke of it again.

174
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:24,560
In time, he seemed to forget
that Eurus had ever even existed.

175
00:13:25,154 --> 00:13:27,453
How could he forget? She was
living in the same house.

176
00:13:27,478 --> 00:13:28,478
No.

177
00:13:29,717 --> 00:13:32,460
- They took her away.
- Why?

178
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,979
You don't lock up a child
because a dog goes missing.

179
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,420
Quite so.

180
00:13:39,227 --> 00:13:42,915
It was what happened
immediately afterwards.

181
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:47,205
She knows where he is.

182
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,229
We can't make her tell us.

183
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:51,630
We can't make her do anything!

184
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:16,188
After that, our sister had

185
00:14:16,213 --> 00:14:18,419
- to be taken away.
- Where?

186
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,019
Oh, some suitable place,
or so everyone thought.

187
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,219
Not suitable enough, however.

188
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,899
- She died there.
- How?

189
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:29,619
She started another fire.
One which she did not survive.

190
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,859
This is a lie.

191
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,380
Yes.

192
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,379
It is also a kindness.

193
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,379
This is the story I told our
parents to spare them further pain,

194
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:42,059
and to account for the absence
of an identifiable body.

195
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,099
And no doubt to prevent
their further interference.

196
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,859
Well, that, too, of course.

197
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,579
The depth of Eurus's psychosis
and the extent of her abilities

198
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,019
couldn't hope to be contained
in any ordinary institution.

199
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,499
Uncle Rudi took care of things.

200
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,019
Where is she, Mycroft?
Where's our sister?

201
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,179
There's a place called Sherrinford.

202
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,739
An island.

203
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:06,619
It's a secure and very
secret installation

204
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,259
whose sole purpose is to contain
what we call the uncontainables.

205
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:16,019
The demons beneath the road?
This is where we trap them.

206
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,859
Sherrinford is more than
a prison, or an asylum.

207
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,259
It is a fortress,

208
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:24,219
built to keep the rest of the
world safe from what is inside it.

209
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,360
Heaven may be a fantasy for
the credulous and the afraid.

210
00:15:30,037 --> 00:15:32,485
But I can give you a
map reference for hell.

211
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,819
That's where our sister has
been since early childhood.

212
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,939
She hasn't left,
not for a single day.

213
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,099
Whoever you both met,
it can't have been her.

214
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,339
- Keep back! Keep as still as you can!
- What is it?

215
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,637
- It's a drone.
- Yeah, I can see that.

216
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:15,004
What's it carrying?

217
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:18,259
What's that silver thing
on top of it, Mycroft?

218
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:20,539
It's a DX-707.

219
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,739
I've authorised the purchase
of quite a number of these.

220
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,700
Colloquially, it is known
as the patience grenade.

221
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,179
Patience?

222
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,939
The motion sensor has activated.

223
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,620
If any of us move, the grenade

224
00:16:34,645 --> 00:16:36,299
- will detonate.
- How powerful?

225
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,859
It'll certainly destroy this
flat and kill anyone in it.

226
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,459
Assuming walls of reasonable strength,

227
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,939
your neighbours should be safe,
but as it's landed on the floor,

228
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,499
I am moved to wonder if
the cafe below is open.

229
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,179
- It's Sunday morning, so it's closed.
- What about Mrs Hudson?

230
00:16:57,777 --> 00:17:00,819
Going by her usual routine, I estimate
she has another two minutes left.

231
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,899
She keeps the vacuum cleaner
at the back of the flat.

232
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,740
- So?
- So safer there, when

233
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:06,579
she's putting it away.

234
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:09,259
But we have to move eventually and
we should do it when she's safest.

235
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:12,259
When the vacuum stops, we give her eight
seconds to get to the back of the flat.

236
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,259
She's fast when she's
cleaning. Then we move.

237
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:17,259
What's the trigger response time?

238
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:20,219
Once we're mobile, how
long before detonation?

239
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,459
We have a maximum of three
seconds to vacate the blast radius.

240
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,659
John and I will take the
windows, you take the stairs.

241
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,179
- Help get Mrs Hudson out, too.
- Me?

242
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,139
- You're closer.
- You're faster.

243
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,579
Speed differential won't be
as critical as the distance.

244
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:33,699
Yes, agreed.

245
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,739
She's further away.
She's moving to the back.

246
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,979
I estimate we have a minute left.

247
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:41,179
- Is a phone call possible?
- Phone call?

248
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,899
John has a daughter, he
may wish to say goodbye.

249
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,995
I'm sorry, Dr Watson, any movement will
set off the grenade. I hope you understand.

250
00:17:49,036 --> 00:17:50,835
Oscar Wilde.

251
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,962
What?

252
00:17:51,963 --> 00:17:56,315
He said, "The truth is
rarely pure and never simple".

253
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,099
It's from The Importance Of Being
Earnest. We did it at school.

254
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,204
So did we, now I recall.

255
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,899
I was Lady Bracknell.

256
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,179
Yeah. You were great.

257
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,779
- You really think so?
- Yes, I really do.

258
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,779
Well, that's good to know.

259
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,660
I've always wondered.

260
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,510
Good luck, boys.

261
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:25,460
Three, two, one, go!

262
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,659
'And now the shipping forecast,
issued by the Met Office

263
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:02,899
'on behalf of the Maritime
Coastguard Agency at 05.05.

264
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,107
'Thames, Dover...'

265
00:19:05,132 --> 00:19:07,012
Go on, son, get it up.

266
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,339
Better out than in.

267
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,979
Is it always like this?

268
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,219
- No.
- Thank God!

269
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,579
Usually, it's much worse.

270
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,589
I might go and work in a bank!

271
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,780
Is that an helicopter?

272
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:24,579
No, not in this weather.

273
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:27,019
'...Shannon, Malin, Sherrinford.

274
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,659
'Sherrinford.

275
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,899
'Sherrinford.'

276
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,939
- Do you hear that?
- 'Sherrinford.'

277
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,299
I never heard that one before.

278
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,979
Sherrinford?

279
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,163
Forget you ever heard it.

280
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:37,955
What?

281
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:41,859
Sometimes when we're out in
these waters, we get that message.

282
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,499
Just forget about it.

283
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,220
- Yeah, but we've never...
- Just...!

284
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,139
- Who the hell are you?!
- My name's Sherlock Holmes.

285
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,619
The detective.

286
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,390
The pirate.

287
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,899
Golf Whiskey X-ray, this
is a restricted area.

288
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,339
Repeat, restricted area.

289
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,259
You are off course.
Are you receiving?

290
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:29,619
Golf Whiskey X-ray, you are
off course. Are you receiving?

291
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,379
'We are receiving you.
This is a distress call.

292
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,819
'Repeat, distress call.
We're in trouble here.'

293
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,220
Golf Whiskey X-ray,
what is your situation?

294
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,739
Golf Whiskey X-ray,
where are you now?

295
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,100
'We're headed for the
rocks, we're going to hit!'

296
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,699
Governor to the control room!

297
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:52,339
'Lockdown in progress!
Lockdown in progress!

298
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:55,499
'Please proceed to
designated red stations.

299
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,019
'Please proceed to
designated red stations.'

300
00:21:06,027 --> 00:21:08,859
- Hold it! Wait, wait, wait!
- Wait! Wait!

301
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,380
In the sand! In the sand!

302
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,859
I need to speak to Mycroft.

303
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,859
He's in hospital,
there was an explosion.

304
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,339
Put me through to the hospital.

305
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,819
He's not conscious.
He's severely injured.

306
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:28,659
No-one is even confident
he's going to pull through.

307
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,019
Where's his brother?
Where's Sherlock Holmes?

308
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,219
Missing.

309
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,139
No, he's not, he's here!

310
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,419
Sir, we found two more from the boat.

311
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:40,259
'He stole our boat! Him and
another fella, with guns!'

312
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,900
- Where'd you find them?
- 'North side of the island, sir.'

313
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:49,259
- Holding cell, now!
- 'Right, sir.'

314
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,820
'Lockdown in progress.'

315
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,099
This is a mistake!

316
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,539
I'm the victim here, this man
stole my boat! He's a pirate.

317
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,819
- Yeah, I really am.
- Please, sit down.

318
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,379
I don't even know who he is!

319
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:08,379
He's Dr John Watson, formerly of
the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.

320
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,819
- What are you doing here?
- It's a hospital. Any work?

321
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,219
It's not a hospital.

322
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,859
I want eyes on Eurus Holmes.

323
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,579
Go straight to the special unit,

324
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,319
deploy green and yellow
shift, on my authority.

325
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:19,459
Sir.

326
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,059
I'm sparing your blushes because
we're supposed to be on the same side.

327
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,179
And frankly, this is embarrassing.

328
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,219
Ooh. Doing a cavity search?

329
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,979
The true art of disguise,
according to your famous friend,

330
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,579
is not being looked at.

331
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,842
But I am looking at
you, aren't I, Mr Holmes?

332
00:22:39,732 --> 00:22:41,779
Yes, you are.

333
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,340
But that is sort of the point, isn't it?

334
00:22:46,058 --> 00:22:49,459
You see, you should have been looking
at the guy you just gave your pass to.

335
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:51,220
Ah!

336
00:23:00,344 --> 00:23:02,779
That's the trouble with
uniforms and name badges,

337
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,019
people stop looking at faces.

338
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,819
We'd be better off with clown outfits.

339
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,939
At least they'd be satirically relevant.

340
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:12,379
Oh, you'll find the real Landers on the
north shore, tied up with two others.

341
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,779
- Two others?
- Hm. Well, it was trial and error.

342
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:16,459
We had to find the right waistband.

343
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:18,619
This is insane! This is unnecessary.

344
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,219
No, your security is compromised
and we don't know who to trust.

345
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,739
And that justifies dressing up?

346
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,300
Yes, it does!

347
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,659
It justifies dressing up or
any damn thing I say it does!

348
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:32,459
Now, listen to me, for your own
physical safety, do not speak.

349
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,019
Do not indulge in any non-verbal signals

350
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,339
suggestive of internal thought!

351
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,379
If the safety of my
sister is compromised,

352
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:41,699
if the security of my
sister is compromised,

353
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,579
if the incarceration of
my sister is compromised,

354
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:48,979
in short, if I find any indication my
sister has left this island at any time,

355
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,180
I swear to you, you will not!

356
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,419
- Say thank you to Dr Watson.
- Why?

357
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:59,379
He talked me out of Lady Bracknell.
This could have been very different.

358
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,939
Are you in?

359
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,539
Just arriving at the secure unit.
Explain.

360
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,179
'Door opening.'

361
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,859
Prison within a prison.

362
00:24:06,884 --> 00:24:10,595
Eurus must be allowed the strict
minimum of human interaction.

363
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,371
- Why?
- Since you're determined to

364
00:24:12,396 --> 00:24:14,484
meet her, you're about to find out.

365
00:24:16,393 --> 00:24:19,939
Eyes on Eurus Holmes.
Governor's orders.

366
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,099
Answer yes or no.

367
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,059
Has there ever been, against
my express instructions,

368
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:27,579
any attempt at a psychiatric
evaluation of Eurus Holmes?

369
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:30,259
- Yes.
- I presume the tapes are in my office.

370
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,752
- Your office?
- Cast your mind

371
00:24:31,777 --> 00:24:33,324
back. It used to be yours.

372
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,499
You haven't been down
here before, have you?

373
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,299
Silence Of The Lambs, basically.

374
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,819
- You what?
- Keep your distance.

375
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,579
Stay at least three feet away
from the glass, and all that.

376
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,059
Why the headphones?

377
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,339
She doesn't stop playing.
Sometimes for weeks.

378
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,819
Beautiful.

379
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:51,140
- Kills you in the end.
- Aye, still beautiful, though.

380
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,740
'Door closing.'

381
00:25:42,388 --> 00:25:44,667
'Why am I here?

382
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:46,208
'Why do you think you're here?

383
00:25:46,233 --> 00:25:48,739
'No-one ever tells me.'

384
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,619
- 'Am I being punished?
- You've been bad.

385
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,619
'There's no such thing as bad.

386
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,179
- 'What about good?
- Good and bad are fairytales.

387
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:09,019
'We have evolved to attach
an emotional significance

388
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,619
'to what is nothing more than a
survival strategy of the pack animal.

389
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:15,139
'We are conditioned to
invest divinity in utility.

390
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,299
'Good isn't really good,
evil isn't really wrong,

391
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,539
'bottoms aren't really pretty. You
are a prisoner of your own meat.

392
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,259
'Why aren't you?

393
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,779
'I'm too clever.'

394
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,299
- Did you bring it?
- Sorry?

395
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,859
My hairband. Did you
bring it, like I asked?

396
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:39,019
I'm not one of the...
I-I don't work here.

397
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,979
My special hairband.

398
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,339
I'm not one of your doctors.

399
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:47,033
The one I made you steal from Mummy.

400
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,179
It was the last thing
I said to you, remember?

401
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,219
The day they took me away.

402
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,438
No.

403
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:58,499
- No?
- We've spoken since then.

404
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,259
You came round to my
flat a few weeks back,

405
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,619
you pretended to be a woman
called Faith Smith. We had chips.

406
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,419
Does this mean you
didn't bring my hairband?

407
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,939
How did you manage to get out of
this place? How did you do that?

408
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,419
Easy. Look at me.

409
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:13,379
I am looking at you.

410
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,539
You can't see it, can you?

411
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:19,219
You try and try, but you just
can't see, you can't look.

412
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,939
See what?

413
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,019
- What do you think?
- Beautiful.

414
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,699
- You're not looking at it.
- I meant your playing.

415
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,899
Oh, the music!

416
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,659
I never know if it's beautiful
or not, only if it's right.

417
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,859
Often they're the same thing.

418
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,659
If they're not always
the same thing, what's

419
00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:35,299
the point in beauty?
Look at the violin.

420
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,179
I need to know how you escaped.

421
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,620
Look at the violin.

422
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,739
- It's a Stradivarius.
- It's a gift.

423
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:46,860
- Who from?
- Me.

424
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,420
- Why?
- You play, don't you?

425
00:28:08,775 --> 00:28:10,300
How did you know?

426
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:14,260
How did I know?

427
00:28:15,447 --> 00:28:19,139
I taught you. Don't you remember?
How can you not remember that?

428
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,363
Eurus, I don't remember you at all.

429
00:28:21,388 --> 00:28:22,948
Interesting.

430
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,179
Mycroft told me you'd
rewritten your memories,

431
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:28,379
he didn't tell me you'd
written me out completely.

432
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:30,339
What do you mean, rewritten?

433
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,419
You still don't know
about Redbeard, do you?

434
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:37,259
Oh! This is going to be
such a good day.

435
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:38,939
'She smiles at you
when you come home...'

436
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,059
Everyone we sent in there,
it's hard to describe,

437
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,579
- it's... it's like she...
- Recruited them.

438
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,379
'Smiling is advertising.'

439
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,859
Enslaved them.

440
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,579
She's been capable of
that since she was five.

441
00:28:50,580 --> 00:28:52,579
She's an adult now.

442
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:55,421
I warned you. I ordered you.

443
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,499
She's clinically unique.
We had to try.

444
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,139
At what cost?

445
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,579
'Happiness is a pop song.
Sadness is a poem.'

446
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,940
What cost?

447
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:09,579
Tell me the worst
thing that has happened.

448
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:13,659
She kept suggesting to Dr Taylor
that he should kill his family.

449
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,059
- And?
- He said it was like an earworm,

450
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,379
couldn't get her out of his head.

451
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,859
- And?
- He left.

452
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,700
- And?
- Killed himself.

453
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,499
And?

454
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,419
His family.

455
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,940
'Are you going to cry?

456
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,699
'It's OK if you cry.

457
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,259
'I don't want to cry.

458
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,700
'I can help you cry.'

459
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,388
- Play for me.
- I need to know

460
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:40,859
how you got out of here.

461
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,220
You know already! Look
at me. Look and play.

462
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,801
No, not Bach. You clearly
don't understand it. Play you.

463
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:59,401
- Me?
- You.

464
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,739
Oh! Have you had sex?

465
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,379
Why do you ask?

466
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,135
The music. I've had sex.

467
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,267
How?

468
00:30:10,292 --> 00:30:12,179
One of the nurses got careless.
I liked it.

469
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,059
Messy, though.
People are so breakable.

470
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,699
I take it he didn't consent.

471
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:17,059
- He?
- She?

472
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,059
Afraid I didn't notice
in the heat of the moment.

473
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:22,939
And afterwards, well,
you couldn't really tell.

474
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,740
Is that vibrato, or
is your hand shaking?

475
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:33,539
I warned you explicitly,
no-one was to talk to her alone.

476
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,659
- You spoke to her.
- I know what I'm doing!

477
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,419
You even brought her a
visitor on Christmas Day.

478
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,059
I took a calculated risk.

479
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,579
You gave her a Christmas present.

480
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,179
Remember her Christmas present?

481
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:47,099
I am aware of the dangers Eurus poses

482
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,819
and equipped to deal with them.

483
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,099
What dangers?

484
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:55,939
Eurus doesn't just talk to
people, she... reprograms them.

485
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,580
Anyone who spends time with her
is automatically compromised.

486
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,539
'I'm only trying to help
you. We can help each other.

487
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,619
'Helping someone is the best
way you can help yourself.

488
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,499
'I don't trust you.'

489
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,099
So, clearly you remember me?

490
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,139
I remember everything.
Every single thing.

491
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,539
You just need a big enough hard drive.

492
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,059
- 'Sherlock?'
- Not now.

493
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,859
- 'Vatican Cameos.'
- In a minute.

494
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,339
Let's continue.

495
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,459
Did they tell you to keep
three feet from the glass?

496
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,579
- Yes.
- Be naughty, step closer.

497
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:31,460
- Why?
- Do it. Step closer.

498
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,179
Tell me what you remember.

499
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:40,099
You, me and Mycroft.

500
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:44,019
Mycroft was quite clever. He could
understand things if you went a bit slow,

501
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:47,579
but you, you were my favourite.

502
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:50,019
Why was I your favourite?

503
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,899
Because I could make you laugh.
I loved it when you laughed.

504
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,099
Once, I made you laugh all night,
I thought you were going to burst.

505
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,819
I was so happy.

506
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:00,259
Then Mummy and Daddy had
to stop me, of course.

507
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,339
- Why?
- Well, turns out I'd got it wrong.

508
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,299
Apparently, you were screaming.

509
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,139
Why was I screaming?

510
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,100
Redbeard!

511
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,019
- I remember Redbeard.
- Do you now?

512
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,057
Tell me what I don't know.

513
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,220
Touch the glass.

514
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,739
I put my trust in
you, my implicit trust,

515
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,539
as governor of this institute!

516
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,139
It's obvious when it all started.

517
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,619
Well, she was never the
same after that Christmas.

518
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,939
It's as if you woke her up.

519
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,499
That is entirely beside the point!

520
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,979
- You had your orders and failed to act on them.
- Listen to the tape.

521
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:55,020
- Sorry?
- Do it now, listen.

522
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:59,219
- My sister's methods of...
- Just listen.

523
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,179
'You have no idea how I could help.

524
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,339
'Bring me your wife.
I want to meet her.

525
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,659
'I don't need your help.'

526
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,859
Redbeard was my dog.

527
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,859
I know what happened to Redbeard.

528
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:12,979
Oh, Sherlock, you know nothing.

529
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,686
Touch the glass and
I'll tell you the truth.

530
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,499
I'll touch it, too, if you're scared.

531
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,739
'I can fix her for you and then
I'll give you her straight back,

532
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,899
'good as new, I promise.

533
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:31,899
'That's all. What you're proposing
is not... It's not... right.'

534
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,179
Everyone who went in there got affected.

535
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,219
- Enslaved, you said.
- Yes.

536
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,779
- One after the other?
- Yes.

537
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,099
- Dr Watson, I think we've...
- Shut up!

538
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,619
'Do you trust your wife?'

539
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,659
One question, that's
your voice, isn't it?

540
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,059
'Do you really? Do you trust her?

541
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:47,979
'You've got to stop
saying these things.'

542
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,459
If Eurus has enslaved you, then who
exactly is in charge of this prison?

543
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,379
'It's completely inappropriate.'

544
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,299
I'm sorry.

545
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,099
- No!
- Very, very sorry.

546
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,860
No!

547
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:12,379
You think it's a trick.

548
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,859
You look so unsure.

549
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,059
You're not used to
being unsure, are you?

550
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,019
It's more common than you'd think.

551
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,540
Look at you.

552
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:26,099
The man who sees through everything

553
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,243
is exactly the man who doesn't notice...

554
00:34:30,446 --> 00:34:33,566
...when there's nothing to see through.

555
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,780
Do you see how it was done?
I know you like explanations.

556
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:45,099
The signs, you suspended the signs!

557
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,059
And my voice? Throat mic.

558
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:48,459
Puts me through the speakers.

559
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,459
Don't you think it's clever?

560
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,459
- Simple, but clever.
- Transparent.

561
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,477
Well, you do keep asking
me how I got out of here.

562
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,419
Like this.

563
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:12,059
Get in here, all of you!
Stop me killing him!

564
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,419
No, no, stop me in a minute.

565
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,099
'Red alert! Red alert!

566
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,899
'Big, red, bouncy, red alert!'

567
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,979
- Dr Watson...!
- 'Klingons attacking lower decks!

568
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:27,699
'Also cowboys in black
hats and Darth Vader.

569
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,779
'Don't be alarmed! I'm
here now, I'm here now!

570
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,539
'Did you miss me? Did you miss me?

571
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,139
'Miss me? Miss me?

572
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,659
'Miss me? Miss me?

573
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:38,859
'Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? Miss me?

574
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,459
'Miss me? Miss me? Miss me? Miss me...?'

575
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:44,819
- Mr Moriarty.
- Big G.

576
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:49,059
Big G means Governor. Street speak.

577
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,499
I'm a bit down with the kids, you know.

578
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,299
I'm relatable that way.

579
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,459
Do you like my boys?

580
00:36:56,460 --> 00:37:02,220
This one's got more stamina, but
he's less caring in the afterglow.

581
00:37:03,928 --> 00:37:05,448
This way, please.

582
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:24,832
Smell all that insane criminality.

583
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,579
Do you have cannibals here?

584
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,462
- Yes. Three.
- How many? That's good.

585
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,339
People leave their bodies to science,

586
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:36,140
I think cannibals would
be so much more grateful.

587
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:08,259
Ah! Isn't that sweet?

588
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,939
Won't you sit down?

589
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,130
I wrote my own version of the
Nativity when I was a child.

590
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:14,339
The Hungry Donkey.

591
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:18,619
It was a bit gory, but if you're
going to put a baby in a manger,

592
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,463
you're asking for trouble.

593
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,511
You know what this
place is, of course?

594
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:25,633
Of course.

595
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,819
So, am I under arrest again?

596
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,539
You remain a person of interest,

597
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,539
but until you commit a verifiable crime,

598
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,899
you are, I regret, at liberty.

599
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:37,619
- Then why am I here?
- You're a Christmas present.

600
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:40,380
Ah. How do you want me?

601
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,299
There is, in this facility,

602
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,939
a prisoner whose intellectual abilities

603
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,739
are of occasional use to
the British government.

604
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:52,499
What, for, like, really difficult sums,
long division, that sort of thing?

605
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:55,699
She predicted the exact dates of
the last three terrorist attacks

606
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,299
on the British mainland
after an hour on Twitter.

607
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,259
That sort of thing.

608
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,099
In return, however,
she requires treats.

609
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,939
Last year, it was a violin.

610
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,180
This year?

611
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,698
Five minutes unsupervised
conversation... with you.

612
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,860
Me?

613
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,059
With me?

614
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:24,739
She has noted your interest in the
activities of my little brother.

615
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:30,460
So, what has she got to
do with Sherlock Holmes?

616
00:39:34,224 --> 00:39:36,144
Whatever you're about to tell me...

617
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:41,540
...I already know it's
going to be... awesome!

618
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,940
I'm your Christmas present.

619
00:40:18,866 --> 00:40:20,346
So, what's mine?

620
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,060
Redbeard.

621
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,660
How are you?

622
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:01,460
- Bit of a lump.
- True, that, but you have your uses.

623
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,219
- Did you see your sister?
- Yes.

624
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,739
- How was that?
- Family is always difficult.

625
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,299
Is this an occasion for banter?

626
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,819
Case in point.

627
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,499
- Are we phoning someone?
- Apparently.

628
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,659
- What's he doing here?
- As he is told.

629
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,659
Eurus is in control.

630
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,619
Help me. Please, I'm on a
plane and everyone's asleep!

631
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,379
Help me!

632
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,259
'Hello. My name's Jim Moriarty.

633
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:33,379
'Welcome to the final problem.'

634
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,179
- It's OK, he's dead.
- He doesn't sound dead.

635
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:38,259
'This is a recorded announcement.

636
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,419
'Please say hello to some
very old friends of mine.'

637
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,699
Hello? I can hear you talking.

638
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,419
'Please help me! I'm on a
plane and it's going to crash!'

639
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,659
- What is this? We can't do this!
- Do shut up, dear.

640
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,179
- 'Is someone there?!'
- Is this supposed to be a game?

641
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,339
- Be quiet.
- 'Please help me!'

642
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:57,379
Oh, hello. Um...
try... try to stay calm.

643
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,899
Just... tell me... tell
me what your name is.

644
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,659
I'm not supposed to tell
my name to strangers.

645
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:04,619
Of course not, very good.
But, um... I'll tell you mine.

646
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:07,299
My name is...

647
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,019
Hello?

648
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,146
Oh, dear. We seem to
have lost the connection.

649
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,499
How have you done this?
How is any of this possible?

650
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:19,396
You put me in here, Mycroft,
you brought me my treats.

651
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:21,700
What treats?

652
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,299
'Clever, Eurus! You go, girl!'

653
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:31,539
How can that be Moriarty?

654
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:36,179
Oh, he recorded lots of little
messages for me before he died.

655
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,099
Loved it. Did you know his
brother was a stationmaster?

656
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,939
I think he was always jealous.

657
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,859
The girl, where is she?

658
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:44,619
Can I talk to her again?

659
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,139
Poor little thing.

660
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:50,379
Alone in the sky in a great
big plane with nowhere to land.

661
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:52,139
But where in the world is she?

662
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,699
It's a clever little puzzle.

663
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:56,864
If you want to apply yourself
to it, I can reconnect you,

664
00:42:56,889 --> 00:42:58,369
but first...

665
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,579
That's my wife.

666
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:06,035
That's my wife!

667
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:09,579
Oh, God, that's my wife!

668
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,139
I'm going to shoot
the governor's wife.

669
00:43:11,140 --> 00:43:13,299
Please! No!

670
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,979
Please! Help her!

671
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,299
In about a minute... bang! Dead!

672
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:22,459
- Please don't do that.
- Well, you can stop me.

673
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:25,594
- How?
- There's a gun in the hatch. Take it.

674
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,899
You want to save
the governor's wife,

675
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,079
choose either Dr Watson or
Mycroft to kill the governor.

676
00:43:35,104 --> 00:43:37,384
Oh! Oh, God!

677
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,099
You can't do it, Sherlock. If you do it,
it won't count. I'll kill her, anyway.

678
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:47,268
It has to be your
brother or your friend.

679
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,380
You have to do this.

680
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,260
Eurus will kill her!

681
00:43:56,161 --> 00:43:57,859
It doesn't appear we have a choice.

682
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,778
Right, then. Countdown's starting.

683
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:03,269
How long?

684
00:44:03,294 --> 00:44:05,859
No, no, no, the countdown is for me.

685
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:09,659
Withholding the precise deadline will
apply the emotional pressure more evenly.

686
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:14,419
Where possible, please give me an explicit
verbal indication of your anxiety levels,

687
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,819
I can't always read
them from your behaviour.

688
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,819
I can't do this.

689
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,619
I can't, it's murder.

690
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:23,379
This is not murder,
this is saving my wife.

691
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,339
I'm particularly focused
on internal conflicts,

692
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:29,699
where strategising around a
largely-intuitive moral code

693
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,659
appears to create a
counterintuitive result.

694
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:34,499
I will not kill.

695
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,459
I will not have blood on my hands!

696
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,539
Yes, very good. Thank you.

697
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,739
Killing my wife is what you are doing.

698
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,260
No!

699
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,020
OK, fine.

700
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,100
John?

701
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:54,459
Dr Watson, are you married?

702
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:55,859
I was.

703
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,660
- What happened?
- She died.

704
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,939
What would you give to get her back?

705
00:45:01,964 --> 00:45:03,904
I mean, if you could,
if it was possible,

706
00:45:03,905 --> 00:45:05,619
what would you do to save her?

707
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,899
Eurus will kill me.

708
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:10,499
Please save my wife.

709
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,059
There will, I'm afraid,
be regular prompts

710
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,979
to create an atmosphere of urgency.

711
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:18,699
'Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock.

712
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:22,340
'Tick-tick-tick-tick,
tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock.'

713
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:35,999
What's your name?

714
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,359
David.

715
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,839
And you're sure about this, David?

716
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,359
Of course I'm bloody sure!

717
00:45:40,384 --> 00:45:42,615
Nearly there.

718
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,799
Right, do you want to pray or anything?

719
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:48,160
With Eurus Holmes in the world,
who the hell would I pray to?

720
00:45:49,256 --> 00:45:51,719
You are a good man and
you are doing a good thing.

721
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,039
So are you.

722
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,360
I'll spend the rest of my
life telling myself that.

723
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,480
Please!

724
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:26,519
Oh, God!

725
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,489
I know that you're scared, but
you should also be very proud.

726
00:46:29,514 --> 00:46:32,920
Just do it! Be quick!

727
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:38,479
'Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.'

728
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,839
This is very good, Dr Watson.

729
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,719
I should have fitted
you with a cardiograph.

730
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,360
Goodbye, David.

731
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,240
'Tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock-tock,
tick-tick-tick.'

732
00:46:51,875 --> 00:46:54,759
Please!

733
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,719
I can't. I'm sorry, I can't do it.

734
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,359
I know, it's all right.

735
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,240
Stop! No, no! Stop!

736
00:47:02,136 --> 00:47:03,679
I'm sorry.

737
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,439
- It's all right.
- I'm so sorry!

738
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,919
Remember me.

739
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:08,960
No!

740
00:47:15,956 --> 00:47:18,011
Are you all right?

741
00:47:18,927 --> 00:47:20,487
Interesting.

742
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,919
All right, there you go, you got
what you wanted, and he's dead.

743
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:29,079
Dead or alive, he really
wasn't very interesting.

744
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:32,359
But you three, you three were wonderful.

745
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:34,040
Thank you.

746
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,719
You see, what you did, Dr Watson,
specifically because of your moral code,

747
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:42,039
because you don't want
blood on your hands,

748
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,199
two people are dead instead of one.

749
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,399
Two people?

750
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,702
Yes. Sorry.

751
00:47:47,727 --> 00:47:49,247
Hang on.

752
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:04,039
What advantage did your
moral code grant you?

753
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,959
Is it not, in the end, selfish
to keep one's hands clean

754
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,719
at the expense of another's life?

755
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,439
You didn't have to kill her!

756
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,319
Huh! The condition of her survival

757
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,520
was that you or Mycroft
had to kill her husband.

758
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,799
This is an experiment.

759
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,719
There will be rigour.

760
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,799
Sherlock, pick up the
gun. It's your turn next.

761
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,519
When I tell you to use it, and I will,

762
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,839
remember what happened this time.

763
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,559
What if I don't want a gun?

764
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,759
Oh, the gun is intended as a mercy.

765
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,519
- For whom?
- You.

766
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,659
- How so?
- If someone else had to die,

767
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:40,095
would you really want to
do it with your bare hands?

768
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,160
It would waste valuable time.

769
00:48:48,185 --> 00:48:49,985
Probably just take it.

770
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:58,319
There's only one bullet left.

771
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,079
You will only need one.

772
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:02,919
But you will need it.

773
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,359
Please, go through.

774
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,719
There's a few tasks for you

775
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:13,085
and a girl on a plane is
getting very, very scared.

776
00:49:17,539 --> 00:49:18,858
Treats?

777
00:49:18,883 --> 00:49:22,359
Yes. You know, a violin.

778
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,439
In exchange for?

779
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,119
She's very clever.

780
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,318
I'm beginning to think you're not.

781
00:49:29,065 --> 00:49:32,744
'Come on now, all aboard!

782
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:37,639
'Choo-choo! Choo-choo! Choo-choo!

783
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,439
'Choo-choo! Choo-choo!

784
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,679
'Choo-choo!

785
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,199
'Choo-choo! Choo-choo!'

786
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:49,359
Someone's been redecorating.

787
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:52,199
- Is that allowed?
- She's literally taken over the asylum,

788
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:54,919
we have more to worry about
than her choice of colour scheme.

789
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,199
Barely dry. Recent.

790
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:59,039
And it's for our benefit.

791
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:02,239
As a motivator to your
continued cooperation,

792
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:04,759
I'm now reconnecting you.

793
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:09,775
'Fasten your seatbelts, it's
going to be a bumpy night.'

794
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,319
'Are... are you still there?'

795
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:13,119
Yes, hello?

796
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,399
Hello, we're still
here, can you hear us?

797
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,359
- Yes.
- 'Everything is going to be all right,

798
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,920
'I-I just need you to
tell me where you are.

799
00:50:19,945 --> 00:50:22,024
'Outside, is it day or night?'

800
00:50:22,049 --> 00:50:25,079
- Night.
- That certainly narrows it down to half the planet!

801
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:27,479
- What kind of a plane are you on
- 'I don't know.'

802
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,220
- Is it big or small?
- 'Big.'

803
00:50:29,245 --> 00:50:30,759
Lots of people on it?

804
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:33,559
Lots and lots, but they're all
asleep, I can't wake them up.

805
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,479
- Where did you take off from?
- 'And the driver's asleep.'

806
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:39,439
No, I understand, but
where did you come from?

807
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,839
'Where did the plane take off?'

808
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,239
- My nan's.
- And where are you going?

809
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:45,159
- 'Home.'
- No, I mean what airport...

810
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,799
Enough for now.
Time to play a new game.

811
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,599
Look on the table in front
of you. Open the envelope.

812
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,079
If you want to speak to the girl again,

813
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:56,319
earn yourself some phone time!

814
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:58,319
This is inhuman, this is insane!

815
00:50:58,320 --> 00:50:59,520
Mycroft, we know!

816
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:03,404
Six months ago, a man
called Evans was murdered.

817
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,280
Unsolved, except by me.

818
00:51:06,726 --> 00:51:10,240
He was shot from a distance
of 300 metres with this rifle.

819
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,039
Now, if the police had any brains,

820
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,799
they'd realise there are
three suspects, all brothers,

821
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:20,039
Nathan Garrideb, Alex
Garrideb and Howard Garrideb.

822
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,839
All these photos are up to date,

823
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:26,599
but which one pulled
the trigger, Sherlock?

824
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,204
Which one?

825
00:51:28,229 --> 00:51:32,199
What's this, we're supposed
to solve this based on what?

826
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,519
This. This is all we get.

827
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,319
Please, make use of
your friends, Sherlock.

828
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,479
I want to see you interact with
people that you're close to.

829
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:42,360
Also, you may have to
choose which one to keep.

830
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,799
What do you make of it? Am I
being asked to prove my usefulness?

831
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:47,999
Yes, I should think you are.

832
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,999
I will not be manipulated like this.

833
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,468
Fine. John? John!

834
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:57,399
Yeah, I think I've seen one
of these. It's a buffalo gun.

835
00:51:57,400 --> 00:52:01,759
I'd say 1940s, old-fashioned
sight. No crosshairs.

836
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,159
Glasses, glasses. Nathan wears glasses.

837
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,799
Evans was shot from 300 metres.

838
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,880
The kickback from a
gun with this calibre...

839
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,359
...would be massive.

840
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:17,279
No cuts, no scarring.

841
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,919
It's not Nathan, then. Who's next?

842
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:20,759
Well done, Dr Watson.
How useful you are.

843
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,959
Do you have a suspicion
we're being made to compete?

844
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,999
We're not competing. There's a plane
in the air that's going to crash,

845
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:28,279
so what we're doing is
trying to save a little girl.

846
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:30,879
Today, we have to be
soldiers, Mycroft, soldiers.

847
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,040
And that means to hell
with what happens to us!

848
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,319
Your priorities do you credit.

849
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,559
No, my priorities just
got a woman killed.

850
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,639
Now, as I understand it, Sherlock,

851
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,679
you try to repress your emotions
to refine your reasoning.

852
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,319
I'd like to see how that
works. So, if you don't mind,

853
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,400
I'm going to apply some
context to your deductions.

854
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,319
Oh, dear God!

855
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,639
Two of the Garridebs
work here as orderlies,

856
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,599
so getting the third along
really wasn't too difficult.

857
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:05,159
Once you bring in your verdict, let
me know and justice will be done.

858
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:07,039
- Justice?
- What will you do with them?

859
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,719
Early release.

860
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,119
You'll drop them into the sea.

861
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,639
Sink or swim.

862
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,039
They're tied up!

863
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:15,439
Exactly! Now there is context.

864
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,919
Please continue with your deductions.

865
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,759
I'm now focusing on the
difference to your mental capacity

866
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,879
a specified consequence can make.

867
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,239
Why should we bother?

868
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:27,399
What if we're disinclined to
play your games, little sister?

869
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,799
Hm-hm! I have, if you remember,

870
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,039
provided you with some motivation.

871
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:36,159
'We're going through
the clouds, like cotton wool.'

872
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,959
Oh, that's nice. Try to
tell me more about the plane.

873
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,799
Why won't my mummy wake up?

874
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:47,675
So it's got to be one of
the other two. Now, Howard...

875
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,439
Howard's a lifelong
drunk, pallor of his skin,

876
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,519
terminal gin blossoms on his red nose.

877
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:55,480
And, terror notwithstanding,
a bad case of the DTs.

878
00:53:59,686 --> 00:54:02,599
There's no way he could have taken
that shot from 300 metres way.

879
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,239
So that leaves us with Alex.

880
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:06,999
Indentations on the temples
suggest he habitually wears glasses.

881
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,919
Frown lines suggest
a lifetime of peering.

882
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,359
He's short-sighted, or he was.

883
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,239
His recent laser surgery
has done the trick.

884
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,279
- Laser surgery? - Look at his
clothes, he's made an effort.

885
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,239
- That's very good.
- Excellent.

886
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,993
Suddenly he sees himself
in quite a different

887
00:54:19,017 --> 00:54:20,439
light now that he's
dumped the specs.

888
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:21,759
He even has a spray tan.

889
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,719
But he's clearly not used to
his new personal grooming ritual.

890
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,777
That can be told by the state
of his fingernails and

891
00:54:26,802 --> 00:54:28,639
the fact that there's
hair growing in his ears.

892
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,719
So it's a superficial job, then.

893
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,759
But he got his eyes fixed,
his hands were steady.

894
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,799
He pulled the trigger.
He killed Evans.

895
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:36,999
Are you ready to condemn the prisoner?

896
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,799
Sherlock, we can't do this.

897
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:40,199
The plane, remember?

898
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,960
Sherlock, are you ready?

899
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,799
Alex.

900
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:49,799
Say it. Condemn him.

901
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,480
Condemn him in the knowledge of
what will happen to the man you name.

902
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,520
I condemn Alex Garrideb.

903
00:54:59,869 --> 00:55:01,668
'Mind the gap.'

904
00:55:01,693 --> 00:55:04,879
Congratulations, you got the right one.

905
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,319
Now, go through the door.

906
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,599
You dropped the other two, why?

907
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,439
- Interesting.
- Why?!

908
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,039
Does it really make a difference,

909
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:14,479
killing the innocent
instead of the guilty?

910
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,119
Let's see.

911
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:19,359
'The train has left the station!'

912
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:22,519
No. That felt pretty much the same.

913
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,200
John?

914
00:55:24,225 --> 00:55:25,645
Don't let her distract you.

915
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,311
- Distract me?
- Soldiers today.

916
00:55:50,696 --> 00:55:52,239
One more minute on the phone.

917
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,319
'I'm frightened!
I'm really frightened!'

918
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,519
It's OK, don't worry.
I don't have very long with you,

919
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:59,479
so I just need you tell me what
you can see outside the plane.

920
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:01,999
Just the sea. I can see the sea.

921
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,439
- Are there ships on it?
- 'No ships.

922
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:06,319
'I can see lights in the distance.'

923
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,319
- Is it a city?
- 'I think so.'

924
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:10,799
She's about to fly over a
city in a pilotless plane.

925
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,159
We'll have to talk her through it.

926
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,400
- Through what?
- 'Hello?

927
00:56:13,425 --> 00:56:14,759
Are you still there?'

928
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,599
Still here. Just give us a minute.

929
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:19,359
Getting the plane away from any
mainland, any populated areas.

930
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:21,759
- It has to crash in the sea.
- What about the girl?

931
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,039
Well, obviously, Dr Watson, she's
the one who's going to crash it.

932
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,839
No. We could help her land it.

933
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:29,079
And if we fail and she
crashes into a city?

934
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,279
How many will die then?

935
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,919
How are we going to get her to do that?

936
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,119
I'm afraid we're going
to have to give her hope.

937
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:37,199
Is there really no-one
there that can help you?

938
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:39,319
Have you really, really checked?

939
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:42,039
Everyone's asleep.
Will you help me?

940
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,639
We're going to do
everything that we can.

941
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,679
'I'm scared. I'm really scared!'

942
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:46,959
It's all right, I...

943
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,279
Now, back to the
matter in hand. Coffin.

944
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,919
Problem, someone is about to die.

945
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,199
It will be, as I
understand it, a tragedy.

946
00:56:55,200 --> 00:56:56,919
So many days not lived,

947
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:02,119
so many words unsaid, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera...

948
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,599
Yes, yes, yes, and this, I
presume, will be their coffin.

949
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,079
Whose coffin, Sherlock?

950
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:09,759
Please, start your deductions.

951
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,759
I will apply some context in a moment.

952
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,879
Well, allowing for the entirely
pointless courtesy of headroom,

953
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,119
I'd say this coffin is intended
for someone of about five foot four.

954
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,959
- Makes it more likely to be a woman.
- Not a child?

955
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:22,599
A child's would be more expensive.
This is in the lower price range,

956
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,639
although still best
available in that bracket.

957
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:26,199
That was a lonely night on Google.

958
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,079
This is a practical
and informed choice.

959
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:30,919
The balance of probability suggests
that this is for an unmarried woman,

960
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,479
distant from her close relatives.

961
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,639
That is suggested by the economy of choice,
acquainted with the process of death,

962
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,879
but unsentimental about the necessity
of disposal. The lining of the coffin...

963
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,824
Yes, very good, Sherlock, or we could
just look at the name on the lid.

964
00:57:46,040 --> 00:57:47,439
Only it isn't a name.

965
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:50,359
So it's for somebody who loves somebody.

966
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,279
It's for somebody who loves Sherlock.

967
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,560
This is all about you,
everything here.

968
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,359
So, who loves you?

969
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,519
I'm assuming it's not a long list.

970
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,729
Irene Adler. Don't be ridiculous.
Look at the coffin.

971
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,918
Unmarried, practical about death, alone.

972
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,959
- Molly.
- Molly Hooper.

973
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,159
She's perfectly safe, for the moment.

974
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,999
Her flat is rigged to explode
in approximately three minutes,

975
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,359
unless I hear the release
code from her lips.

976
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,999
I'm calling her on your phone, Sherlock.

977
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,799
- Make her say it.
- Say what?

978
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,276
Obvious, surely.

979
00:58:26,301 --> 00:58:27,284
- No.
- Yes.

980
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,039
Oh, one important restriction,
you're not allowed to mention

981
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,999
in any way at all that
her life is in danger.

982
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:38,319
You may not, at any point, suggest
that there is any form of crisis.

983
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:41,509
If you do, I will end
this session and her life.

984
00:58:41,534 --> 00:58:43,107
Are we clear?

985
00:58:43,132 --> 00:58:45,599
'Tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock,

986
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:48,159
'tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tick...'

987
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,959
- What's she doing?
- She's making tea.

988
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,599
But why isn't she answering her phone?

989
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,839
You never answer your phone.

990
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,720
Yes, but it's me calling.

991
00:59:09,602 --> 00:59:13,359
'Hi, this is Molly
at the dead centre of town.

992
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:15,559
'Leave a message.'

993
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:19,399
OK, OK. Just one more time.

994
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,719
Go on, Molly, pick up.
Just bloody pick up.

995
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,039
'Hello, Sherlock. Is this urgent?
Because I'm not having a good day.'

996
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:44,719
Molly, I just want you to do something
very easy for me and not ask why.

997
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,319
Oh, God! Is this one
of your stupid games?

998
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:50,919
No, it's not a game.
I need you to help me.

999
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,079
- Look, I'm not at the lab.
- It's not about that.

1000
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:56,360
Well, quickly, then.

1001
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,279
Sherlock! What is it,
what do you want?

1002
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,159
'Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...'

1003
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:06,559
Molly, please, without asking
why, just say these words.

1004
01:00:06,560 --> 01:00:07,959
What words?

1005
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,360
I love you.

1006
01:00:10,864 --> 01:00:12,464
- Leave me alone.
- Molly, no, please,

1007
01:00:12,489 --> 01:00:14,400
no! Don't hang up! Do not hang up!

1008
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:17,479
Calmly, Sherlock, or I will
finish her right now.

1009
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:18,839
Why are you doing this to me?!

1010
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,119
Why are you making fun of me?!

1011
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:22,319
Please, I swear, you just
have to listen to me.

1012
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,199
Softer, Sherlock.

1013
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:27,119
Molly, this is for a case.

1014
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:28,999
It's... it's a sort of experiment.

1015
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,039
I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.

1016
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,599
No, I know you're not an
experiment, you're my friend.

1017
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:37,679
We're friends, but, please,
just say those words for me.

1018
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:42,439
Please don't do this.
Just... just... don't do it.

1019
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:44,519
It's very important.

1020
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:45,999
I can't say why.

1021
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,599
But I promise you, it is.

1022
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,759
I can't say that, I can't...
I can't say that to you.

1023
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,799
Of course you can.
Why can't you?

1024
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,159
'You know why.'

1025
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,959
No, I don't know why.

1026
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,719
Of course you do.

1027
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:01,439
'Tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock,

1028
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,159
'tick-tick-tick-tick-tick.'

1029
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,044
Please, just say it.

1030
01:01:06,419 --> 01:01:08,919
'I can't. Not to you.'

1031
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,439
Why?

1032
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:13,799
Because... because it's true.

1033
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:17,759
Because... it's true, Sherlock.

1034
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,089
It's always been true.

1035
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,640
Well, if it's true,
just say it anyway.

1036
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:27,639
You bastard!

1037
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,079
'Say it anyway.'

1038
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:33,839
'You say it. Go on.
You say it first.'

1039
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,600
- What?
- Say it. Say it like you mean it.

1040
01:01:39,238 --> 01:01:41,118
Final 30 seconds.

1041
01:01:47,531 --> 01:01:48,771
I...

1042
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,520
..I love you.

1043
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:58,920
I love you.

1044
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,720
Molly?

1045
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,000
Molly, please!

1046
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,839
I love you.

1047
01:02:31,040 --> 01:02:32,679
Sherlock, however hard that was...

1048
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,880
Eurus, I won. I won.

1049
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:39,160
Come on, play fair. The girl on
the plane, I need to talk to her.

1050
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:43,279
I won! I saved Molly Hooper!

1051
01:02:43,280 --> 01:02:45,239
Huh!

1052
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:47,479
Saved her? From what?

1053
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,919
Oh, do be sensible, there were
no explosives in her little house.

1054
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,039
Why would I be so clumsy?

1055
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:55,359
You didn't win, you lost.

1056
01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:57,839
Look what you did to her.
Look what you did to yourself.

1057
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,879
All those complicated little
emotions, I lost count.

1058
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:05,199
Emotional context, Sherlock,
it destroys you every time.

1059
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:09,079
Now, please, pull yourself together.
I need you at peak efficiency.

1060
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,200
The next one isn't going to be so easy.

1061
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,240
In your own time.

1062
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,480
- Sherlock?
- No. No!

1063
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:37,760
No! No! No!

1064
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:44,439
No! No! No!

1065
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,999
I know this is difficult, and
I know you're being tortured,

1066
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,799
but you have got to keep it together.

1067
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,639
This isn't torture, this is vivisection.

1068
01:04:16,664 --> 01:04:20,161
We're experiencing science from
the perspective of lab rats.

1069
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:23,480
Huh!

1070
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:27,960
- Soldiers?
- Soldiers.

1071
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,679
'Tick-tock! Tickets, please!'

1072
01:04:38,680 --> 01:04:41,999
Hey, Sis, don't mean to
complain, but this one's empty.

1073
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,319
What happened, did you run out of ideas?

1074
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,799
It's not empty, Sherlock. You've
still got the gun, haven't you?

1075
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,679
I told you you'd need it, because
only two can play the next game.

1076
01:04:50,680 --> 01:04:52,799
Just two of you go on from here.

1077
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,679
Your choice, it's make-your-mind-up time.

1078
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,039
Whose help do you need
the most, John or Mycroft?

1079
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,439
It's an elimination round.

1080
01:05:01,440 --> 01:05:03,959
You choose one and kill the other.

1081
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:06,239
You have to choose, family or friend.

1082
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,479
Mycroft or John Watson?

1083
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:11,199
'Tick-tick-tick-tick-tick-tick...'

1084
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,319
- Eurus, enough!
- Not yet, I think, but nearly.

1085
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:19,280
Remember, there's a plane in the
sky and it's not going to land.

1086
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,999
- Well?
- Well, what?

1087
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:27,279
We're not actually going
to discuss this, are we?

1088
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:31,039
I'm sorry, Dr Watson, you're
a fine man in many respects.

1089
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,960
Make your goodbyes and shoot him.

1090
01:05:34,720 --> 01:05:36,559
- Shoot him!
- What?

1091
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,799
Shoot Dr Watson.

1092
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:43,079
There's no question who has to
continue from here, it's us. You and me.

1093
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:45,759
Whatever lies ahead requires
brainpower, Sherlock,

1094
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:47,279
not sentiment.

1095
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,039
Don't prolong his agony, shoot him.

1096
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,679
Do I get a say in this?

1097
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:54,399
Today, we are soldiers.
Soldiers die for their country.

1098
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:57,560
I regret, Dr Watson, that
privilege is now yours.

1099
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,000
Shit, he's right.

1100
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,199
He is, in fact, right.

1101
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,399
Make it swift. No need
to prolong his agony.

1102
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,600
Get it over with
and we can get to work.

1103
01:06:16,120 --> 01:06:19,319
Oh, God! I should have expected this.

1104
01:06:19,320 --> 01:06:22,959
Pathetic. You always were
the slow one. The idiot.

1105
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,679
That's why I've always despised you.

1106
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:28,759
You shame us all. You
shame the family name.

1107
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:31,839
Now, for once in your
life, do the right thing.

1108
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:34,879
Put this stupid little
man out of all our misery.

1109
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:36,159
Shoot him!

1110
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,639
- Stop it.
- Look at him. What is he?

1111
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,399
Nothing more than a distraction,
a little scrap of ordinariness

1112
01:06:41,400 --> 01:06:44,799
for you to impress, to
dazzle with your cleverness.

1113
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,999
You'll find another.

1114
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,799
- Please, for God's sake, just stop it.
- Why?

1115
01:06:48,800 --> 01:06:52,839
Because, on balance, even your
Lady Bracknell was more convincing.

1116
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:55,839
Ignore everything he just
said, he's being kind.

1117
01:06:55,840 --> 01:06:58,160
He's trying to make it
easy for me to kill him.

1118
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,760
Which is why this is
going to be so much harder.

1119
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:07,119
You said you liked my Lady Bracknell.

1120
01:07:07,120 --> 01:07:08,759
Sherlock, don't.

1121
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:11,079
It's not your decision, Dr Watson.

1122
01:07:11,080 --> 01:07:13,439
Not in the face, though, please.

1123
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,239
I promised my brain
to the Royal Society.

1124
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,719
Where would you suggest?

1125
01:07:17,720 --> 01:07:20,719
Well, I suppose there is a
heart somewhere inside me.

1126
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:23,559
I don't imagine it's much of a target,

1127
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,839
but why don't we try for that?

1128
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,280
I won't allow this.

1129
01:07:29,400 --> 01:07:32,799
This is my fault. Moriarty.

1130
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:35,839
- Moriarty?
- Her Christmas treat.

1131
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:40,159
Five minutes' conversation with
Jim Moriarty five years ago.

1132
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,559
What did they discuss?

1133
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,600
Five minutes' conversation...

1134
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:49,400
...unsupervised.

1135
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:00,689
Goodbye, brother mine.

1136
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,580
No flowers.

1137
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,960
My request.

1138
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:17,013
Jim Moriarty thought you'd make
this choice. He was so excited.

1139
01:08:18,662 --> 01:08:22,359
'And here we are,
the end of the line.

1140
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:25,720
'Holmes killing Holmes.'

1141
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,520
'This is where I get off.'

1142
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,360
Five minutes.

1143
01:08:39,834 --> 01:08:44,109
It took her just five minutes
to do all of this to us.

1144
01:08:51,796 --> 01:08:53,719
Well, not on my watch.

1145
01:08:53,744 --> 01:08:55,384
What are you doing?

1146
01:08:56,351 --> 01:08:59,199
A moment ago, a brave man
asked to be remembered.

1147
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,759
I'm remembering the governor.

1148
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:04,559
- Ten...
- No! No, Sherlock...

1149
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:07,719
- ...nine, eight...
- You can't!

1150
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,846
- ...seven...
- You don't

1151
01:09:08,871 --> 01:09:10,239
know about Redbeard yet!

1152
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,439
- ...six... five...
- Sherlock!

1153
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:15,039
Sherlock, stop that at once!

1154
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:16,680
...four...

1155
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:19,160
...three...

1156
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,360
...two...

1157
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,840
'Hello?

1158
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,839
'Hello? Are you still there?'

1159
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:48,119
Yes, yeah, no, I'm...
I'm still here. I'm here.

1160
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,279
You went away. You said you'd
help me and you went away.

1161
01:09:51,280 --> 01:09:53,239
Yes, I know.
Well, I'm sorry about that.

1162
01:09:53,240 --> 01:09:55,400
We... we... we must
have got cut off. Um...

1163
01:09:57,737 --> 01:10:00,136
How... how... how long was I away?

1164
01:10:00,161 --> 01:10:01,680
Hours. Hours and hours.

1165
01:10:01,705 --> 01:10:03,639
Why don't grown-ups tell the truth?

1166
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:07,399
No, I-I am telling the truth.
You can trust me.

1167
01:10:07,400 --> 01:10:09,239
'Where did you go?'

1168
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:11,519
I'm not completely sure.

1169
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:14,079
Um... now, I tell you what,

1170
01:10:14,080 --> 01:10:16,919
you... you've got to be
really, really brave for me.

1171
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:20,759
Can you go to the front of
the plane? Can you do that?

1172
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,879
- 'The front?'
- Yes, that's right, the front.

1173
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,079
- 'You mean where the driver is?'
- Yes, that's it.

1174
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,640
OK. I'm going.

1175
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,319
- Are you there yet?
- Yeah, I'm here.

1176
01:10:34,344 --> 01:10:36,005
- John?
- Yeah?

1177
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,039
Where are you?

1178
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:39,519
I don't know. I've just woken up.
Where are you?

1179
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:42,359
I'm in another cell. I just spoke
to the girl on the plane again.

1180
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:44,519
- We've been out for hours.
- What, she's still up there?

1181
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,359
Yes. The plane will keep flying
until it runs out of fuel.

1182
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:48,136
Is Mycroft with you?

1183
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,839
I have no idea, I can
hardly see anything.

1184
01:10:49,840 --> 01:10:51,800
Mycroft? Mycroft?

1185
01:10:52,922 --> 01:10:55,439
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

1186
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,959
Keep exploring. Tell me anything
you can about where you are.

1187
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,799
The walls are... rough.
They're rock, I guess.

1188
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:02,008
What are you standing on?

1189
01:11:02,033 --> 01:11:06,492
Er... stone, I think, but, listen,
there's about two feet of water.

1190
01:11:09,160 --> 01:11:11,079
Chains.

1191
01:11:11,080 --> 01:11:14,559
Yeah, my feet are chained up.
I can feel something.

1192
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,919
Bones, Sherlock.
There are bones in here.

1193
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:24,520
What kind of bones?

1194
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:28,200
Er... I don't know. Small.

1195
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:36,639
- Redbeard.
- 'Who's Redbeard?'

1196
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:39,439
Oh, hello. Are you at the
front of the plane now?

1197
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,959
Yeah. I still can't wake the driver up.

1198
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:44,239
That's all right.
What can you see now?

1199
01:11:44,240 --> 01:11:45,879
I can see a river.

1200
01:11:45,880 --> 01:11:48,359
- There's... there's... there's a big wheel.
- All right.

1201
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:51,079
Well, you and I are going to
have to drive this plane together.

1202
01:11:51,080 --> 01:11:52,599
Just you and me.

1203
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,319
- We are?
- Yeah. There's nothing to it.

1204
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:58,199
We just need to get in touch
with some people on the ground.

1205
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,719
Now, um... can you see anything
that looks like a radio?

1206
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:03,479
No.

1207
01:12:03,480 --> 01:12:06,319
That's all right, but keep
looking, we've got plenty of time.

1208
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,799
- What's wrong?
- The whole plane's shaking.

1209
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,359
It's just turbulence, it's
nothing to worry about.

1210
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,039
My ears hurt.

1211
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:16,959
Does the river look
like it's getting closer?

1212
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,159
A little bit.

1213
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:21,759
All right, then, that
means you're nearly home.

1214
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:25,666
Sherlock? I'm in a well.

1215
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,869
That's where I am.
I'm in the bottom of a well.

1216
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,479
Why would there be a
well in Sherrinford?

1217
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,000
Why is there a draft?

1218
01:12:40,360 --> 01:12:42,519
Walls don't contract
after you've painted them.

1219
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,000
Not real ones.

1220
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:52,959
I'm home. Musgrave Hall.

1221
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,999
'Me and Jim Moriarty,
we got on like a house on fire.

1222
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:57,679
'Which reminded me of home.'

1223
01:12:57,680 --> 01:12:59,411
Yeah, it's just an old
building, I don't care.

1224
01:12:59,435 --> 01:13:00,919
The plane, tell me about the plane now!

1225
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:03,959
'Sweet Jim, he was never very
interested in being alive,

1226
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:06,359
'especially if you could
make more trouble being dead.'

1227
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,999
Yeah, still not interested.
The plane!

1228
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,479
'You knew he'd take his revenge.

1229
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,199
'His revenge, apparently, is me.'

1230
01:13:13,200 --> 01:13:16,679
Eurus, let me speak to the little girl on
the plane and I'll play any game you like.

1231
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:19,359
'First, find Redbeard.'

1232
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:21,519
I'm letting the water in now.

1233
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,519
You don't want me to drown
another one of your pets, do you?

1234
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:30,039
At long last, Sherlock Holmes, it's
time to solve the Musgrave ritual.

1235
01:13:30,040 --> 01:13:34,319
Your very first case,
and the final problem.

1236
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,839
Oh! Bye-bye.

1237
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:38,159
Sherlock!

1238
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,799
Sherlock!

1239
01:13:50,120 --> 01:13:51,839
John! John? Can you hear me?!

1240
01:13:54,200 --> 01:13:57,239
- John?!
- Argh! Help me! Help me, please!

1241
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:58,719
Sherlock!

1242
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,599
- John?
- Yeah, it's flooding. The well is flooding!

1243
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,719
- Try as long as possible not to drown.
- What?!

1244
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,999
I'm going to find you!
I am finding you!

1245
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:09,599
Well, hurry up, please,
because I don't have long!

1246
01:14:09,600 --> 01:14:12,599
Yargh! It's leaning over!
The whole plane!

1247
01:14:24,099 --> 01:14:27,599
Eurus, you said the answer's in the song,
but I went through the song, line by line

1248
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:30,519
all those years ago and I found
nothing. I couldn't find anything!

1249
01:14:30,520 --> 01:14:33,159
There was a beech tree
in the grounds and I dug.

1250
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:34,999
I dug, I dug and dug and dug.

1251
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,559
16 feet by six.

1252
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:40,039
16 yards, 16 metres,
and I found nothing!

1253
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,919
No-one!

1254
01:14:41,920 --> 01:14:43,439
Sherlock?

1255
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:47,199
It was a clever little
puzzle, wasn't it?

1256
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:50,080
So, why couldn't you
work it out, Sherlock?

1257
01:14:51,640 --> 01:14:54,039
Sherlock, there's
something you need to know.

1258
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,599
Emotional context.

1259
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,799
And here it comes.

1260
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:02,959
Sherlock, the bones I found...

1261
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,839
Yes. They're dogs'
bones, that's Redbeard.

1262
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:08,759
Mycroft's been lying
to you, to both of us.

1263
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:11,319
They're not dogs' bones.

1264
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:15,119
Remember Daddy's allergy?
What was he allergic to?

1265
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:18,679
What would he never let you
have, all those times you begged?

1266
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,319
Well, he'd never let you have a dog.

1267
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:27,759
Come on, Redbeard.

1268
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:30,160
Your funny little memory, Sherlock.

1269
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:38,360
You were upset, so you told
yourself a better story.

1270
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,560
But we never had a dog.

1271
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,959
Victor!

1272
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,400
Now it's coming.

1273
01:16:07,160 --> 01:16:08,680
Victor Trevor.

1274
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,240
We played pirates.

1275
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,200
I was Yellowbeard and he was...

1276
01:16:18,710 --> 01:16:20,389
...he was Redbeard!

1277
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:23,976
You were inseparable,
but I wanted to play, too.

1278
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:29,880
Oh! Oh, God!

1279
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:38,199
What... what did you do?

1280
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,800
Please let me out!
Please, someone help me! Please!

1281
01:17:01,920 --> 01:17:04,880
'Come on, Redbeard.'

1282
01:17:14,120 --> 01:17:16,559
Victor!

1283
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:20,880
Deep water, Sherlock, all
your life, in all your dreams.

1284
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,919
Deep waters.

1285
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,480
You killed him!

1286
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:33,319
You killed my best friend.

1287
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:36,240
I never had a best friend.

1288
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,480
I had no-one.

1289
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:57,480
Play with me, Sherlock.
Play with me.

1290
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,040
No-one.

1291
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:06,600
No-one.

1292
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:13,120
OK. OK, let's play.

1293
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:26,799
'Hello? Are you there?'

1294
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,519
I need your help. I'm
trying to solve a puzzle.

1295
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,319
- 'But what about the plane?!'
- The puzzle will save the plane.

1296
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:35,999
The wrong dates. She used the
wrong dates on the gravestones

1297
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:38,439
as the key to the cipher,
and the cipher was the song.

1298
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:40,879
Is this strictly relevant?!

1299
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:43,240
Yes, it is.
I'll be with you in a minute.

1300
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,559
The lights are getting closer!

1301
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:54,879
Hush now, working.

1302
01:18:54,880 --> 01:18:56,640
Let's number the words of the song.

1303
01:18:58,600 --> 01:18:59,959
Then rearrange the numbered words

1304
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:01,640
to match the sequence
on the gravestones.

1305
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,959
I am lost.

1306
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,119
Help me brother.

1307
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,199
Save my life

1308
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,359
before my doom.

1309
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:19,079
I am lost

1310
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:21,399
without your love.

1311
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:24,280
Save my soul, seek my room.

1312
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:29,880
Oh, God!

1313
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,519
We're going to crash!
I'm going to die! Argh!

1314
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:43,159
I think it's time you
told me your real name.

1315
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,400
I'm not allowed to tell
my name to strangers.

1316
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:49,880
But I'm not a stranger, am I?

1317
01:19:52,440 --> 01:19:54,040
I'm your brother.

1318
01:19:58,080 --> 01:19:59,760
I'm here, Eurus.

1319
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,759
You're playing with me, Sherlock.

1320
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,559
We're playing the game.

1321
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,679
The game, yes, I get it now.

1322
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:18,039
The song was never a set of directions.

1323
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:20,719
I'm in the plane. I'm going to crash.

1324
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,039
And you're going to save me.

1325
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:24,479
Look how brilliant you are.

1326
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,799
Your mind has created
the perfect metaphor.

1327
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,919
You're high above us,
all alone in the sky,

1328
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:32,879
and you understand
everything except how to land.

1329
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,920
Now, I'm just an idiot,
but I'm on the ground.

1330
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,159
I can bring you home.

1331
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:40,239
No.

1332
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:42,479
No, no. It's too late now.

1333
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,879
No, it's not, it's not too late.

1334
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:49,719
Every time I close my
eyes, I'm on the plane.

1335
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,359
I'm lost, lost in the sky

1336
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:56,160
and... no-one can hear me.

1337
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:01,360
Open your eyes.

1338
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:03,920
I'm here.

1339
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:09,399
You're not lost anymore.

1340
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:19,839
Now, you... you just, you just went
the wrong way last time, that's all.

1341
01:21:19,840 --> 01:21:22,079
This time, get it right.

1342
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:24,159
Tell me how to save my friend.

1343
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:29,280
Eurus, help me save John Watson.

1344
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:45,439
I just spoke to your brother.

1345
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,039
How is he? He's a bit
shaken up, that's all.

1346
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:51,279
She didn't hurt him, she just
locked him in her old cell.

1347
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:54,439
What goes around comes around.
Give me a moment, boys.

1348
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:57,799
Um... Mycroft, make
sure he's looked after.

1349
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,039
He's not as strong as he thinks he is.

1350
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,360
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.
- Thanks, Greg.

1351
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,959
The helicopter ready?

1352
01:22:07,960 --> 01:22:09,759
Let's move her, then.

1353
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,479
Is that him, sir, Sherlock Holmes?

1354
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:12,719
Fan, are you?

1355
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,039
Well, he's a great man, sir.

1356
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,680
No, he's better than that.

1357
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:19,920
He's a good one.

1358
01:22:23,200 --> 01:22:25,481
- You OK?
- I said I'd bring her home.

1359
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:29,199
I can't, can I?

1360
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:33,281
Well, you gave her what she
was looking for, context.

1361
01:22:33,306 --> 01:22:34,586
Is that good?

1362
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:37,080
It's not good, it's not bad, it's...

1363
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,640
It is what it is.

1364
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:45,015
Alive for all these years?!

1365
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:48,239
How is that even possible?!

1366
01:22:48,240 --> 01:22:52,919
What Uncle Rudi began, I
thought it best to continue.

1367
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:57,999
I'm not asking how you did it,
idiot boy, I'm asking how could you?!

1368
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:01,679
- I was trying to be kind.
- Kind?!

1369
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:03,399
Kind?!

1370
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,719
You told us that our daughter was dead!

1371
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:09,919
Better that than tell
you what she had become.

1372
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,959
I'm sorry.

1373
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:16,559
Whatever she became,
whatever she is now, Mycroft,

1374
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,039
she remains our daughter.

1375
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,639
And my sister.

1376
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,359
Then you should have done better.

1377
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:24,359
He did his best.

1378
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:26,720
Then he's very limited.

1379
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,759
Where is she?

1380
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:33,319
Back in Sherrinford.
Secure this time.

1381
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,079
People have died.

1382
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:39,239
Without doubt, she will kill
again if she has the opportunity.

1383
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:42,359
There's no possibility
she'll ever be able to leave.

1384
01:23:42,360 --> 01:23:43,880
When can we see her?

1385
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:47,399
There's no point.

1386
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:49,839
How dare you say that?!

1387
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:51,599
She won't talk.

1388
01:23:51,600 --> 01:23:54,039
She won't communicate
with anyone in any way.

1389
01:23:54,040 --> 01:23:57,559
She has passed beyond our view.

1390
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:00,320
There are no words
that can reach her now.

1391
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:03,080
Sherlock?

1392
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:09,159
Well? You were always the grown-up.

1393
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:11,440
What do we do now?

1394
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,920
Er... yeah, I-I think
you'd better get round here.

1395
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,719
PS, I know you two.

1396
01:26:27,720 --> 01:26:31,159
And if I'm gone, I know
what you could become.

1397
01:26:31,160 --> 01:26:33,919
Because I know who you really are.

1398
01:26:33,920 --> 01:26:37,159
A junky who solves crimes to get high.

1399
01:26:37,160 --> 01:26:41,331
And the doctor who never
came home from the war.

1400
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:50,879
Will you listen to me? Who you
really are, it doesn't matter.

1401
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,279
It's all about the legend.

1402
01:26:53,280 --> 01:26:56,669
The stories, the adventures.

1403
01:27:05,695 --> 01:27:08,359
There is a last refuge
for the desperate,

1404
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:11,799
the unloved, the persecuted.

1405
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:15,720
There is a final court
of appeal for everyone.

1406
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:42,759
When life gets too strange,

1407
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:45,719
too impossible, too frightening,

1408
01:27:45,720 --> 01:27:48,640
there is always one last hope.

1409
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:53,199
When all else fails,
there are two men sitting

1410
01:27:53,200 --> 01:27:55,839
arguing in a scruffy flat

1411
01:27:55,840 --> 01:28:00,097
like they've always been
there, and they always will.

1412
01:28:00,960 --> 01:28:04,769
The best and wisest
men I have ever known.

1413
01:28:07,480 --> 01:28:10,269
My Baker Street boys.

1414
01:28:11,357 --> 01:28:14,557
Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson.
