139
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,280
The time was right,
but the date was wrong.

140
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:08,640
Said two days ago. Crossed the date

who sent it?

00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200

00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,800
Do you think he'd lost a lot of
money?

178
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,000
Suicide is pretty common
among City boys.

179
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,040
We don't know that it was suicide.
Come on.

180
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,160
The door was locked from the inside,
you had to climb down the balcony.

181
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,280
Been away three days
judging by the laundry.

182
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,600
Look at the case, there was
something tightly packed inside it.

183
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,440
Thanks. I'll take your word for it.
Problem?

184
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,080
Yeah, I'm not desperate to root
around some bloke's dirty underwear.

185
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,640
Those symbols at the bank, the
graffiti, why were they put there?

186
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,720
Some sort of code? Obviously.

187
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,120
Why were they painted? Want to
communicate, why not use e-mail?

188
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,720
Well, maybe he wasn't answering.

189
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,240
Oh, good, you follow.

190
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,080
No.

191
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,680
What kind of a message
would everyone try to avoid?

192
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,720
What about this morning?

193
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:39,200
Those letters you were looking at?
Bills?

194
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,280
Yes. He was being threatened.

195
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,840
MAN'S VOICE IN BACKGROUND

196
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,920
Not by the Gas Board.

197
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,720
DIMMOCK: ...see if we can get prints
off this glass.

198
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,680
Sergeant, we haven't met.

199
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,000
Yeah, I know who you are

200
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,400
and I would prefer it if you didn't
tamper with any of the evidence.

201
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,160
I phoned Lestrade. Is he on his way?
He's busy. I'm in charge.

202
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,000
And it's not Sergeant,
it's Detective Inspector Dimmock.

203
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,640
We're obviously
looking at a suicide.

204
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,240
It does seem the only explanation
of all the facts.

205
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,760
Wrong, it's one possible explanation
of some of the facts.

206
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,160
You've got a solution that you like,
but you are choosing

207
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:23,200
to ignore anything you see
that doesn't comply with it.

208
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,120
Like? Wound's on the right side of
his head.

209
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,400
And? Van Coon was left-handed.

210
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,840
Requires quite a bit of contortion.

211
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,480
Left-handed? I'm amazed you
didn't notice. All you have to do
is look around this flat.

212
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,400
Coffee table on the left-hand side,

213
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,040
coffee mug handle
pointing to the left.

214
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:38,480
Power sockets, habitually used
the ones on the left. Pen and paper

215
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,800
on the left of the phone.
Picked up with his right,
took messages with his left.

216
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,600
D'you want me to go on?
No, I think you've covered it.

217
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,360
I might as well, I'm almost
at the bottom of the list.

218
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,080
There's a knife on the breadboard
with butter on the right side
of the blade

219
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,800
because he used it with his left.
It's highly unlikely

220
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,040
that a left-handed man would shoot
himself in the right of his head.

221
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,200
Conclusion, someone broke in here
and murdered him -

222
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,120
only explanation
of all of the facts.

223
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,200
But the gun?
He was waiting for the killer.

224
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:01,040
He'd been threatened. What?

225
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,920
Today at the bank, sort of a warning.

226
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,960
He fired a shot
when his attacker came in.

227
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,480
And the bullet?
Went through the open window.

228
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,400
Oh, come on(!)

229
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
What are the chances of that?!

230
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,400
Wait until you get the ballistics
report.

231
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,200
The bullet in his brain wasn't
fired from his gun, I guarantee it.

232
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,440
If his door was locked from the
inside, how did the killer get in?

233
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,320
Good, you're finally asking
the right questions.

234
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,640
He's left trying to sort of
cut his hair with a fork,

235
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,440
which of course can never be done.

236
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,320
It was a threat,
that's what the graffiti meant.

237
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,480
I'm kind of in a meeting.

238
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,840
Can you make an appointment
with my secretary?

239
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,080
I don't think this can wait.
Sorry, Sebastian.

240
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:49,080
One of your traders, someone who
worked in your office, was killed.

241
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,880
What? Van Coon.

242
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,960
The police are at his flat.

243
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,840
Killed?!
Sorry to interfere

244
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,040
with everyone's digestion.
Still want to make an appointment(?)

245
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,320
Would maybe nine o'clock
at Scotland Yard suit?

246
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,200
Harrow, Oxford...very bright guy.

247
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:11,240
Worked in Asia for a while, so...

248
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,920
You gave him the Hong Kong accounts?

249
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,160
Lost 5 million in a single morning,
made it all back a week later.

250
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,760
Nerves of steel, Eddie had.

251
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,160
Who'd want to kill him?
We all make enemies.

252
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,920
You don't all end up with a bullet
through your temple.

253
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,360
MOBILE RINGS
Not usually. Excuse me.

254
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,600
It's my chairman.

255
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,480
Police have been on to him.

256
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
Apparently they're telling him

257
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,280
it was a suicide.
Well, they've got it wrong,

258
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,480
Sebastian. He was murdered.

259
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,360
Well, I'm afraid
they don't see it like that.

260
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,600
So? And neither does my boss.

261
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,800
I hired you to do a job.
Don't get sidetracked.

262
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,280
FADING FOOTSTEPS

263
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,720
I thought bankers were all supposed
to be heartless bastards.

264
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,000
HORN BLARES

265
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,720
I need you to get over to Crispians.

266
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,840
Two Ming vases up for auction -
Chenghua.

267
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,040
Will you appraise them? Soo Lin
should go - she's the expert.

268
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,640
Soo Lin has resigned her job.
I need you.

269
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,440
PHONE RINGING

270
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,040
Just locum work.
No, that's fine.

271
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,240
You're, um...
Well, you're a bit over-qualified.

272
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,320
Er, I could always do
with the money.

273
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,840
Well, we've got two
away on holiday this week

274
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,320
and one's just left to have a baby.

275
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,080
It might be a bit mundane for you.

276
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,880
Er, no, mundane is good, sometimes.

277
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,480
Mundane works.

278
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,680
It says here you were a soldier.
And a doctor.

279
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,080
Anything else you can do?

280
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,120
I learned the clarinet at school.

281
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,760
Oh...
LAUGHS
..well, I'll look forward to it.

282
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,520
I said, could you pass me a pen?

283
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,920
What? When?
About an hour ago.

284
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,840
Didn't notice I'd gone out then?

285
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,880
I went to see about a job
at that surgery.

286
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,800
How was it?
Great. She's great.

287
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,760
Who?

288
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,040
The job.

289
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,120
She?!

290
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,240
It.

291
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,560
Yeah, have a look.

292
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,800
"The intruder
who can walk through walls."

293
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,920
It happened last night.

294
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,200
Journalist shot dead in his flat.

295
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,080
Doors locked,
windows bolted from the inside.

296
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,840
Exactly the same as Van Coon.

297
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,880
God! You think...?
He's killed another one.

298
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,920
Brian Lukis,
freelance journalist,

299
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,280
murdered in his flat.

300
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,320
Doors locked from the inside.

301
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,480
You've got to admit,
it's similar.

302
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,800
Both men killed by someone
who can walk through solid walls.

303
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,520
Inspector, do you seriously believe
that Eddie Van Coon was

304
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,920
just another city suicide?

305
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,200
SIGHS
You have seen
the ballistics report, I suppose?

306
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,560
And the shot that killed him.
Was it fired from his own gun?

307
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,960
No. No.
So this investigation might move

308
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:02,600
a bit quicker if you were
to take my word as gospel.

309
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,240
I've just handed you
a murder inquiry.

310
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,440
Five minutes in his flat.

311
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,600
Four floors up.

312
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,360
That's why they think they're safe.

313
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,480
Put a chain across the door,
bolt it shut, think they're
impregnable.

314
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,440
They don't reckon for one second
that there's another way in.

315
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:57,360
I don't understand. Dealing
with a killer who can climb.

316
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,600
What are you doing?
Clings to the walls like an insect.

317
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,680
CLUNK!
That's how he got in.

318
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,680
What?!

319
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,760
He climbed up the side of the walls,
ran along the roof,

320
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,720
dropped in through this skylight.

321
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,800
You're not serious?! Like Spider-Man?

322
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,120
He scaled six floors of a Docklands
apartment building,

323
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:17,640
jumped the balcony and killed
Van Coon. Oh, hold on(!)

324
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,120
That's how he got into the bank -
ran along the window ledge
onto the terrace.

325
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,600
I have to find out
what connects these two men.

326
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,680
Date stamped on the book
is the same day that he died.

327
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,080
Sherlock?

328
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,920
So, the killer goes to the bank,

329
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,040
leaves a threatening cipher
at the bank.

330
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,800
Van Coon panics, returns
to his apartment, locks himself in.

331
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,840
Hours later, he dies.

332
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,720
The killer finds Lukis at the
library, he writes the cipher

333
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,320
on the shelf where he knows
it'll be seen. Lukis goes home.

334
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,520
Late that night, he dies too.

335
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,320
Why did they die, Sherlock?

336
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,320
Only the cipher can tell us.

337
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,560
The world's run on
codes and ciphers, John.

338
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:54,200
From the million-pound
security system at the bank
to the PIN machine

339
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,400
you took exception to. Cryptography
inhabits our every waking moment.

340
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,960
Yes, OK, but...

341
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,720
But it's all computer generated -

342
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,240
electronic codes,
electronic ciphering methods.

343
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,040
This is different.

344
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,160
It's an ancient device.

345
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,520
Modern code-breaking methods
won't unravel it.

346
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,400
Where are we headed?
I need to ask some advice.

347
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,800
What?! Sorry?

348
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,320
You heard me perfectly.
I'm not saying it again.

349
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,040
You need advice?
On painting.

350
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,760
Yes, I need to talk to an expert.

351
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,680
SIREN WAILS

352
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,520
Part of a new exhibition.

353
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,360
Interesting.
I call it...

354
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,800
Urban Bloodlust Frenzy.
CHUCKLES

355
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,680
Catchy(!)

356
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,480
I've got two minutes before
a Community Support Officer

357
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,760
comes around that corner.

358
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,320
Can we do this while I'm working?

359
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,640
Know the author?
I recognise the paint.

360
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:58,360
It's like Michigan...hard-core
propellant.

361
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,560
I'd say zinc.

362
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,080
And what about the symbols?
Do you recognise them?

363
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,240
I'm not even sure
it's a proper language.

364
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,520
Two men have been murdered, Raz.

365
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,640
Deciphering this is the key
to finding out who killed them.

366
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,560
And this is all you've
got to go on(?)

367
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,360
It's hardly much, is it?
Are you going to help us or not?

368
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,000
I'll ask around.

369
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,480
Somebody must know something
about it. Oi!

370
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,680
METALLIC CLATTERING

371
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,560
What the hell do you think you're
doing? This gallery is a listed
public building.

372
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,920
No, no. Wait, wait.
It's not me who painted that.

373
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,400
I was just holding this for...

374
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,680
Bit of an enthusiast, are we?

375
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,320
POLICE RADIO IN BACKGROUND

376
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,960
She was right in the middle of
an important piece of restoration.

377
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
Why would she suddenly resign?

378
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,960
Family problems.
She said so in her letter.

379
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,960
But she doesn't have a family.
She came to this country on her own.

380
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,400
Andy! Look, those teapots,
those ceramics.

381
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,200
They've become her obsession.

382
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,680
She's been working on restoring them
for weeks.

383
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,160
I can't believe
that she would just...abandon them.

384
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,400
Perhaps she was getting
a bit of unwanted attention?

385
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,040
DOOR SLAMS

386
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,760
You've been a while.

387
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,200
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

388
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,240
Custody sergeants don't really
like to be hurried, do they?

389
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,760
Just formalities. Fingerprints,

390
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,360
charge sheet, and I've got to be
in magistrates' court on Tuesday.

391
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,440
What? Me, Sherlock!
In court, on Tuesday!

392
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,080
They're giving me an ASBO!
Good, fine.

393
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,440
You want to tell your little pal
he's welcome to go and own up
any time.

394
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,680
This symbol, I still can't place it.

395
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,320
No, I need you to go
to the police station

396
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,520
and ask about the journalist.
The personal effects
will have been impounded.

397
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,840
Get hold of his diary, or something
that will tell us his movements.

398
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,560
Go and see Van Coon's PA.

399
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,120
If you retrace their steps,
somewhere they'll coincide.

400
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,480
SHUTTER CLICKS

401
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,680
Scotland Yard.

402
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
Flew back from Dalian Friday.

403
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,520
Looks like he had back-to-back
meetings with the sales team.

404
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,000
Can you print me up a copy?

405
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,040
Sure.
What about the day he died?

406
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,080
Can you tell me where he was?
Sorry, I've got a gap.

407
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,920
I have all his receipts.

408
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,920
Your friend...
Listen, whatever you say,

409
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,520
I'm behind you 100 per cent.

410
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,000
...he's an arrogant sod.

411
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:42,400
Well, that was mild.
People say a lot worse than that.

412
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,920
This is what you wanted, isn't it?
The journalist's diary?

413
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,880
What kind of a boss was he, Amanda?
Appreciative?

414
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,440
Um, no. That's not a word I'd use.

415
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:03,200
The only things Eddie appreciated
had a big price tag.

416
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,920
Like that hand cream.
He bought that for you, didn't he?

417
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,000
Look at this one.

418
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,400
Got a taxi from him
on the day he died, £18.50.

419
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,240
That would get him to the office.

420
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,960
Not rush hour. Check the time.
Mid-morning. 18 would get him

421
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,320
as far as... ..The West End.
I remember him saying.

422
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Underground,
printed at one in Piccadilly.

423
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,400
So he got a Tube back to the office.

424
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,800
Why would he get a taxi into town,
and then the Tube back?

425
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,040
Because he was delivering
something heavy.

426
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,920
You wouldn't lug a package
up the escalator.

427
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,840
Delivering?!

428
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
To somewhere near
Piccadilly Station.

429
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,160
Dropped the package,
delivered it, and then...

430
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,400
Stopped on his way. He got peckish.

431
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,000
So you bought your lunch
from here en route to the station

432
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,640
but where were you headed from?

433
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,560
Where did the taxi drop you?

434
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,280
Oof! Right.

435
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,240
Eddie Van Coon brought a package
here the day he died.

436
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,720
Whatever was hidden inside
that case...

437
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,680
I've managed to piece
together a picture

438
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,200
using scraps of information -
credit card bills, receipts.
He flew back from China,

439
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,720
then he came here. Sherlock.

440
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,080
Somewhere in this street, somewhere
near. I don't know where, but...

441
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:17,200
That shop, over there.
How could you tell?

442
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,560
Lukis' diary. He was here too.

443
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:21,760
He wrote down the address. Oh.

444
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,720
SHOP BELL RINGS

445
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,760
Hello.

446
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,200
You want...lucky cat?

447
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,840
No, thanks, no.

448
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,600
£10! £10!

449
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,880
I think your wife, she will like.

450
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,880
Um, thank you.

451
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,040
Sherlock...

452
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,200
The label there.
Yes, I see it.

453
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,800
It's exactly the same as the cipher.

454
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,640
WATSON CLEARS THROAT

455
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,520
It's an ancient number system -
Hang Zhou.

456
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,880
These days only street traders
use it.

457
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,040
Those were numbers written on the
wall at the bank and at the library.

458
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,120
Numbers written in
an ancient Chinese dialect.

459
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,800
It's a 15.

460
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,920
What we thought was the
artist's tag, it's a number 15.

461
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,880
And the blindfold, the horizontal
line. That was a number as well.

462
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,280
The Chinese number one, John.
We found it.

463
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,200
Two men travel back from China,

464
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:05,840
both head straight for
the Lucky Cat emporium.

465
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,040
What did they see?

466
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,120
It's not what they saw.

467
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:13,480
It's what they both brought back
in those suitcases.

468
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,640
And you don't mean duty free.

469
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,000
Thank you.

470
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,400
Think about what Sebastian told us.

471
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,120
About Van Coon, about
how he stayed afloat in the market.

472
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,040
Lost 5 million.
Made it back in a week.

473
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,880
That's how he made such easy money.

474
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,640
He was a smuggler. Mm.

475
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,440
Cover would have been perfect.

476
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,760
Businessman,
making frequent trips to Asia.

477
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,960
Lukis was the same,
a journalist writing about China.

478
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,400
Both of them smuggled stuff about.

479
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,680
The Lucky Cat was their drop-off.

480
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,840
But why did they die?

481
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,520
It doesn't make sense.
If they both turn up at the shop
and deliver the goods,

482
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,200
why would someone threaten them

483
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,440
and kill them after the event,
after they'd finished the job?

484
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,560
What if one of them
was light-fingered?

485
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,520
How do you mean? Stole something.

486
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,040
Something from the hoard.

487
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,040
The killer doesn't know
which of them took it

488
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,520
so threatens them both. Right.

489
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,120
Remind me.

490
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,720
When was the last time
that it rained?

491
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,560
It's been here since Monday.

492
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,160
HE RINGS DOORBELL

493
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,320
No-one's been in that flat
for at least three days.

494
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,360
Could have gone on holiday.

495
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,160
Do you leave your windows open
when you go on holiday?

496
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,160
METALLIC SCREECH

497
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,920
Sherlock!

498
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,840
GROANS
WATER DRIPS

499
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,240
Someone else has been here.

500
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,880
Somebody else broke into the flat
and knocked over the vase,
just like I did.

501
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,880
SNIFFS
DOORBELL RINGS

502
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,920
Do you think maybe
you could let me in this time?

503
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,120
Can you not keep doing this, please?

504
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,280
I'm not the first.

505
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,320
What?
Somebody's been in here before me.

506
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,920
What are you saying?

507
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,440
Size eight feet.

508
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,200
Small, but...athletic.

509
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,000
I'm wasting my breath.

510
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,840
DOORBELL RINGS

511
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,000
Small, strong hands.

512
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,840
Our acrobat.

513
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,760
Why didn't he close the window
when he lef...?

514
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,680
Oh, stupid, stupid!

515
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,680
Obvious.

516
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,280
He's still here.

John...

520
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,840
John!

521
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,560
Oh, I'm Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone

522
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,560
because no-one else can compete
with my massive intellect(!)

The milk's gone off
and the washing's started to smell.

00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:49,160
Somebody left here in a hurry
three days ago. Somebody?

528
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,880
Soo Lin Yao. We have to find her.

529
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,600
How, exactly?

530
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,480
We could start with this.

531
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,480
You've gone all croaky.
Are you getting a cold?

532

COUGHS
I'm fine.

533
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,840
When was the last time
that you saw her?

534
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:11,360
ANDY: Three days ago.
Here at the museum.

535
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,320
This morning they told me
she'd resigned.

536
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,880
Just like that.
Left her work unfinished.

537
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,760
What was the last thing that she did
on her final afternoon?

538
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,080
She does this demonstration
for the tourists, a tea ceremony.

539
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,680
So she would have packed up her
things and just put them in here.

540
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,880
We have to get to Soo Lin Yao.

541
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,200
If she's still alive.
Sherlock!

542
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,840
Oh, look who it is.

543
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,280
Found something you'll like.

544
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
Tuesday morning,

545
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,760
all you've got to do is turn up
and say the bag was yours.

546
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,360
Forget about your court date.

547
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,880
GIRL: Dude, that was rad!

548
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,360
You want to hide a tree, then a
forest is the best place to do it,

549
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,040
wouldn't you say?

550
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,720
People would just walk
straight past, not knowing,

551
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,520
unable to decipher the message.

552
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,800
There. I spotted it earlier.

553
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,680
They've been here.
And that's the exact same paint?

554
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,680
Yeah.

555
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,920
John, if we're going to
decipher this code,

556
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,600
we need to look for more evidence.

557
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,480
Answer your phone.
I've been calling you.

558
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,240
PANTING
I found it.

559
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,000
It's been painted over.

560
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,720
I don't understand. It was...

561
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,840
here.

562
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,400
10 minutes ago. I saw it.

563
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:21,160
A whole load of graffiti.

564
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,240
Somebody doesn't want me to see it.

565
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,520
Sherlock, what are you doing...?
Ssh! John, concentrate.

566
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,360
I need you to concentrate.
Close your eyes.

567
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,880
What? Why? Why? What are you doing?

568
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,560
I need you to maximise
your visual memory.

569
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,520
Try to picture what you saw.

570
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,640
Can you picture it? Yeah.

571
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,400
Can you remember it?
Yes, definitely.

572
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,480
Can you remember the pattern?

573
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:43,200
Yes. How much can you remember it?

574
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,360
Look, don't worry.

575
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,800
Because the average human memory
on visual matters
is only 62% accurate.

576
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,080
Well, don't worry,
I remember all of it. Really?

577
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,520
At least I would, if I could get
to my pockets. I took a photograph.

578
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:56,320
MOBILE BEEPS

580
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,520
Always in pairs, John, look.

581
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,240
Numbers...

582
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,120
come with partners.

583
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,520
God, I need to sleep.

584
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:26,640
Why did he paint it
so near the tracks? No idea.

585
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,720
Thousands of people
pass by there every day.

586
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,720
Just 20 minutes...

587
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,720
Of course.

588
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:36,040
Of course, he wants information.
He's trying to communicate

589
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,280
with his people in the underworld.
Whatever was stolen,
he wants it back.

590
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,920
It's somewhere here, in a code.

591
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,200
We can't crack this
without Soo Lin Yao.

592
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,160
Oh, good.

593
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,920
Two men who travelled back
from China were murdered.

594
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,040
And their killer left them messages
in Hang Zhou numerals.

595
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,040
Soo Lin Yao is in danger.

596
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,920
That cipher, it was just
the same pattern as the others.

597
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,680
He means to kill her as well.

598
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,600
Look, I've tried everywhere -

599
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,200
friends, colleagues.
I don't know where she's gone.

600
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,520
I mean, she could be
a thousand miles away.

601
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,680
What are you looking at?
Tell me more about those teapots.

602
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:18,200
The pots were her obsession.
They need urgent work.

603
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,560
If they dry out,
then the clay can start to crumble.

604
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,680
Apparently, you have to just
keep making tea in them.

605
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,520
Yesterday, only one of those pots
was shining.

606
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,240
Now, there are two.

607
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,960
GRATING

608
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:22,360
Fancy a biscuit with that?

609
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,360
Centuries old.
Don't want to break that.

610
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,880
Hello.

611
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,680
You saw the cipher.

612
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,280
Then you know he is coming for me.

613
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:44,840
You've been clever
to avoid him so far.

614
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,080
I had to finish.

615
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:48,960
To finish this work.

616
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,040
It's only a matter of time.

617
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:55,600
I know he will find me.

618
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,520
Who is he?
Have you met him before?

619
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,600
When I was a girl, we met in China.

620
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,040
I recognised his...

621
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,400
signature.
The cipher?

622
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:16,600
Only he would do this. Zhi Zhu.

623
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,160
Zhi Zhu? The spider.

624
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:26,760
You know this mark?

625
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,880
Yes. It's the mark of a Tong.

626
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,480
Huh? Ancient crime syndicate,
based in China.

627
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,480
Every foot soldier bears the mark.

628
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,800
Everyone who hauls for them.

629
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,720
Hauls?

630
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,240
You mean you were a smuggler?

631
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,240
I was 15.

632
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,840
My parents were dead.

633
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,880
I had no livelihood.

634
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,600
No way of surviving, day-to-day,

635
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,600
except to work for the bosses.

636
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,400
Who are they?

637
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,440
They are called the Black Lotus.

638
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,800
By the time I was 16,

639
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,960
I was taking
thousands of pounds worth of drugs

640
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,880
across the border into Hong Kong.

641
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:33,760
I managed to leave
that life behind me.

642
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,560
I came to England.

643
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,480
They gave me a job, here.

644
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:48,320
Everything was good. New life.

645
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,120
And he came looking for you.

646
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:52,600
Yes.

647
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:58,840
I hoped, after five years...

648
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,960
maybe they would have forgotten me.

649
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,840
But they never really let you leave.

650
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,440
A small community like ours...

651
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:12,960
..they are never very far away.

652
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,040
He came to my flat.

653
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:25,680
He asked me to help him to track down
something that was stolen.

654
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,600
And you've no idea what it was?

655
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,880
I refused to help.

656
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:34,200
So, you knew him well
when you were living back in China?

657
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,960
Oh, yes.

658
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,600
He's my brother.

659
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:57,760
Two orphans.

660
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,640
We had no choice.

661
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:09,000
We could work for the Black Lotus,
or starve on the streets, like
beggars.

662
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:16,120
My brother has become their puppet.

663
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,800
In the power of the one
they call Shan.

664
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,560
The Black Lotus general.

665
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,200
I turned my brother away.

666
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,920
He said I had betrayed him.

667
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,880
Next day, I came to work

668
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:41,280
and the cipher was waiting.

669
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:49,480
Can you decipher these?

670
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:53,920
These are numbers. Yes, I know.

671
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:59,240
Here, the line across the man's
eyes, it's the Chinese number one.

672
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:02,000
And this one is 15.
But what's the code?

673
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,560
All the smugglers know it.

674
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,240
It's based upon a book...

675
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:09,240

676
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,720

00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:18,240
Zhi Zhu has found me.

678
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,520
No, no, Sherlock.

679
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:21,560
Sherlock, wait!

680
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,400
Come here.

00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,360

00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,920
GULPS

697
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,520
How many murders is it going to take

698
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,240
before you start believing
that this maniac's out there?

699
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,960
MUTTERS

700
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,360
A young girl was gunned down
tonight.

701
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:28,200
That's three victims in three days.
You're supposed to be finding him.

702
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,560
Brian Lukis and Eddie Van Coon

703
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:31,920
were working for a gang
of international smugglers.

704
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,480
A gang called the Black Lotus,
operating here in London

705
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,720
right under your nose.

706
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,120
Can you prove that?

707
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,720
What are you thinking?
Pork or pasta? Oh, it's you.

708
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,760
I suppose it's never going
to trouble Egon Ronay, is it?

709
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,320
I'd stick with the pasta.

710
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:59,600
Don't want to be doing roast pork,
not if you're slicing up cadavers.

711
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,960
What are you having?

712
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,400
I don't eat when I'm working.
Digesting slows me down.

713
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,280
So you're working here tonight?

714
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,120
Need to examine some bodies. Some?

715
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:11,920
Eddie Van Coon and Brian Lukis.

716
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,480
They're on my list.

717
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,360
Could you wheel them out again
for me?

718
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:21,600
Well...their paperwork's
already gone through.

719
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,360
You changed your hair. What?

720
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,960
The style.
It's usually parted in the middle.

721
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,560
Yes, well...

722
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:33,800
It's good.

723
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,200
It...suits you better this way.

724
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,920
We're just interested in the feet.

725
00:53:48,920 --> 00:53:50,720
The feet? Yes.

726
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:52,520
Do you mind if we have
a look at them?

727
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,880
Now, Van Coon.

728
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:11,200
Oh! So...

729
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:14,520
So either these two men just
happened to visit the same
Chinese tattoo parlour,

730
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,960
or I'm telling the truth.
What do you want?

731
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,480
I want every book from Lukis'
apartment and Van Coon's.

732
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,720
Their books?

733
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,640
Not just a criminal organisation.
It's a cult.

734
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:34,120
Her brother was corrupted
by one of its leaders.

735
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,560
Soo Lin said the name.

736
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:38,320
Yes, Shan. General Shan.

737
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:40,000
We're still no closer to finding him.

738
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,320
Wrong! We've got almost
all we need to know.

739
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,400
She gave us most of
the missing pieces.

740
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,000
Why did he need to visit his sister?

741
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:50,560
Why did he need her expertise?
She worked at the museum.

742
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:52,760
Exactly. An expert in antiquities.

743
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,320
Of course, I see.
Valuable antiquities, John.

744
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:59,160
Ancient Chinese relics
purchased on the black market.

745
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,400
China's home to a thousand treasures
hidden after Mao's revolution.

746
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,840
The Black Lotus is selling them.

747
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,360
Check for the dates... Here,

748
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:14,000
John,
"arrived from China four days ago".

749
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,560
Anonymous.

750
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,040
The vendor doesn't give his name.

751
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,520
"Two undiscovered treasures
from the East."

752
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,040
One in Lukis' suitcase
and one in Van Coon's.

753
00:55:26,040 --> 00:55:27,520
"Antiquities...

754
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,320
"sold at auction."

755
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:33,680
Look, here's another one.

756
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,400
Arrived from China a month ago,

757
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:38,840
Chinese ceramic statue sold for
£400,000.

758
00:55:38,840 --> 00:55:42,240
Look, a month before that,
Chinese painting, £500,000.

759
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,560
All of them
from an anonymous source.

760
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:48,520
They're stealing them back in China
and one by one feeding them
into Britain.

761
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:55,960
Every single auction coincides
with Lukis or Van Coon
travelling to China.

762
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,120
So what if one of them got greedy
when they were in China?

763
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,680
What if one of them stole something?

764
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:02,000
That's why Zhi Zhu's come.
KNOCK AT DOOR

765
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:05,160
Sorry, are we collecting
for charity, Sherlock?

766
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,320
What?

767
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:09,200
A young man's outside
with crates of books.

768
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,760
So the numbers are references.

769
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,160
To books.

770
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,560
To specific pages
and specific words on those pages.

771
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,840
Right, so...

772
00:56:23,840 --> 00:56:25,960
15 and 1, that means?

773
00:56:25,960 --> 00:56:28,160
Turn to page 15
and it's the first word you read.

774
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:30,560
OK, so what's the message?
Depends on the book.

775
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,480
That's the cunning of the book code.

776
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:35,440
It has to be one that they both own.

777
00:56:39,120 --> 00:56:43,240
OK, fine. This shouldn't take
too long, should it(?)

778
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,000
We found these...at the museum.
Is this your writing?

779
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,600
Er, we hoped Soo Lin
could decipher it for us.

780
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,560
Ta.

781
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,120
Anything else I can do?

782
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,280
To assist you, I mean.

783
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,640
Some silence right now
would be marvellous.

784
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:29,680
Cigarette.

785
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:59,680
Imagine.

786
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,200
CLOCK TICKS

787
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:13,120
WATCH BLEEPS

788
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:14,560
Oh...

789
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:18,160
CHURCH BELLS RING

790
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,080
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

791
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:24,880
but we haven't got anything now
until next Thursday.

792
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,720
WOMAN: This is taking ages.

793
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,080
Sorry.

794
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:32,440
WOMAN: What's the point of booking
an appointment if they
can't stick to it?

795
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,080
Um, what's going on?

796
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:39,240
That new doctor you hired, he
hasn't buzzed the intercom for ages.

797
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:42,000
Let me go and have a word.

798
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,840
Excuse me. Sorry.

799
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:47,360
KNOCKS ON DOOR
John?

800
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,640
John?

801
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,800
GENTLE SNORING

802
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,960
Looks like I'm done.
I thought I had some more to see.

803
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:09,040
Oh, I did one or two of yours.
One or two?

804
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,320
Well, maybe five or six.

805
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,680
I'm sorry,
that's not very professional.

806
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:17,320
No, not really.

807
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,800
I had...a bit of a late one.

808
00:59:21,080 --> 00:59:23,560
Oh, right.

809
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,000
Anyway, see you.

810
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:30,880
So...what were you doing
to keep you up so late?

811
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:33,840
I was attending
a sort of book event.

812
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:38,000
Oh. Oh, she likes books,
does she, your girlfriend?

813
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,880
No, it wasn't a date.

814
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:43,880
Good. I mean, I'm...
And I don't have one tonight.

815
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,800
A book that everybody would own.

816
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:01,680
15, entry 1.

817
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:17,960
I need to get some air.
We're going out tonight.

818
01:00:17,960 --> 01:00:20,080
Actually, I've got a date. What?

819
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:22,240
Where two people who like each other
go out and have fun?

820
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,880
That's what I was suggesting.

821
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,880
No, it wasn't. At least, I hope not.

822
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,480
Where are you taking her?

823
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,040
Er, cinema.

824
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,040
Dull, boring, predictable...

825
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:34,320
Why don't you try this?

826
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:37,200
In London for one night only.

827
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,720
LAUGHS NERVOUSLY

828
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,840
Thanks, but I don't come to you
for dating advice.

829
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:44,040
SARAH: It's years since anyone
took me to the circus.

830
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,280
Right, yes.

831
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:50,400
A friend recommended it to me
and I phoned up.

832
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:52,480
Oh! What are they,
a touring company or something?

833
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,200
I don't know much about it.

834
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,080
I think they're probably from China.

835
01:00:57,080 --> 01:01:00,440
I think so, yes.
There's a coincidence(!)

836
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,840
That's wonderful,
thank you very much.

837
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:07,000
Hi, I have two tickets
reserved for tonight.

838
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,200
And what's the name? Holmes.

839
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:14,960
Actually, I have three in that name.

840
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:17,480
No, I don't think so,
we only booked two.

841
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:21,040
Then I phoned back
and got one for myself as well.

842
01:01:21,040 --> 01:01:23,120
I'm Sherlock.

843
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,000
Hi. Hello.

844
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,000
You couldn't let me have
just one night off.

845
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,520
Yellow Dragon Circus,
in London for one day. It fits.

846
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,240
The Tong sent an assassin
to England...

847
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,520
Dressed as a tightrope walker.
Come on, Sherlock, behave!

848
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,600
We're looking for a killer who can
climb, who can shin up a rope.

849
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:45,320
Where else would you find
that level of dexterity?

850
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,600
Exit visas are scarce in China.

851
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:49,520
They need a good reason
to get out of that country.

852
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:51,320
All I need to do
is have a quick look around...

853
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,120
Fine. You do that,
I'll take Sarah for a pint.

854
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:54,400
I need your help.

855
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,160
I do have a couple of other things
on my mind this evening.

856
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,400
Like what?

857
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:01,440
You are kidding?
What's so important?

858
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,280
Sherlock,
I'm in the middle of a date.

859
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,280
You're going to chase some killer
while I'm trying to...

860
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,360
What?

861
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:09,480
While I'm trying to get off
with Sarah.

862
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,120
Hey... Ready?

863
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:13,600
Yeah.

864
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,840
MURMUR OF CONVERSATION

865
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,040
You said circus.
This is not a circus.

866
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,480
Look at the size of this crowd.

867
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,960
Sherlock, this is...art.

868
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,560
This is not their day job.

869
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:37,040
Sorry, I forgot, they're not
a circus, they're a gang
of international smugglers.

870
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:58,120
LOUDER DRUM BEAT

871
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:50,160
WHOOSH
AUDIENCE GASPS

872
01:03:52,320 --> 01:03:54,360
APPLAUSE

873
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:12,240
Classic Chinese escapology act.

874
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:15,440
Hm?
The crossbow's on a delicate string.

875
01:04:15,440 --> 01:04:18,720
The warrior has to escape his bonds
before it fires.

876
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:27,040
HE SHOUTS

877
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:37,480
DRUM BEAT QUICKENS

878
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,520
GONG
Oh!

879
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:43,400
THEY LAUGH

880
01:04:53,560 --> 01:04:56,600
She splits the sandbag,
the sand pours out.

881
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:59,480
Gradually,
the weight lowers into the bowl.

882
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,360
ESCAPOLOGIST SHOUTS AND STRAINS

883
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:39,320
APPLAUSE

884
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,280
Thank God. My God!

885
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,520
APPLAUSE RESTARTS

886
01:06:12,720 --> 01:06:15,200
Ladies and gentlemen.

887
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:19,840
From the distant moonlit shores
of the Yangtze River,

888
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:22,920
we present, for your pleasure,

889
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:27,200
the deadly Chinese bird spider.

890
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:30,480
APPLAUSE

891
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,640
Did you see that?

892
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,680
Well, well.

893
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,640
DOOR OPENS

894
01:07:12,920 --> 01:07:16,160
COAT HANGERS RATTLE

895
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:23,960
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

896
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:32,920
Found you.

897
01:08:38,280 --> 01:08:41,160
Come on.
Come on. Let's go!

898
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:45,040
I sent a couple of cars.
The old hall is totally deserted.

899
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:48,400
Look, I saw the mark at the circus.
The tattoo that we saw

900
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:50,240
on the two bodies,
the mark of the Tong.

901
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:53,760
Lukis and Van Coon were part of
a smuggling operation.

902
01:08:53,760 --> 01:08:56,280
One of them stole something
in China. Something valuable.

903
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:57,440
The circus performers
were gang members

904
01:08:57,440 --> 01:08:59,600
sent here to get it back.
Get what back?

905
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,520
We don't know.

906
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,200
You don't know?

907
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:09,240
Mr Holmes,
I've done everything you asked.

908
01:09:09,240 --> 01:09:13,040
Lestrade, he seems to think
your advice is worth something.

909
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:14,320
I gave the order for a raid.

910
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,520
Please tell me I'll have something
to show for it.

911
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,360
Other than a massive bill
for overtime.

912
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,640
They'll be back in China by tomorrow.

913
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:28,320
No, they won't leave
without what they came for.

914
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,240
We need to find a hideout.

915
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:31,760
A rendezvous.

916
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:36,040
Somewhere in this message
it must tell us.

917
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,520
Well, I think
perhaps I should leave you to it.

918
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:46,000
No, you don't have to go. Stay.
Yes, it'd be better if you left now.

919
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:49,560
He's kidding.
Please stay if you'd like.

920
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:51,600
Is it just me
or is anyone else starving?

921
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:53,040
Oh, God.

922
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,520
So this is what you do.

923
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:11,360
You and John,
you solve puzzles for a living.

924
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:13,800
Consulting detective.

925
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,840
Oh.

926
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:18,440
Oh!

927
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,760
What are these squiggles?

928
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:26,760
They're numbers.
An ancient Chinese dialect.

929
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:31,080
Oh, right. Well, of course
I should have known that.

930
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:40,160
(I've done punch
and a bowl of nibbles.)

931
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,080
Mrs Hudson, you are a saint.

932
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,480
If it was Monday,
I'd have been to the supermarket.

933
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,040
Thank you. Thank you.

934
01:10:46,040 --> 01:10:47,880
SIRENS PASS BY

935
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,800
So these numbers, it's a cipher?
Exactly.

936
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,200
And each pair of numbers is a word?

937
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,200
How did you know that?

938
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,920
Well, two words
have already been translated. Here.

939
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,720
John. Mmm?

940
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:08,720
John, look at this.

941
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:14,160
Soo Lin at the museum, she started
to translate the code for us.

942
01:11:14,160 --> 01:11:15,840
We didn't see it.

943
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:17,920
Nine mill.

944
01:11:20,320 --> 01:11:21,360
Does that mean millions?

945
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,400
Nine million quid. For what?

946
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,520
We need to know
the end of this sentence.

947
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:29,080
Where are you going?

948
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:32,880
To the museum, to the restoration
room. We must have been
staring right at it. At what?

949
01:11:32,880 --> 01:11:35,800
The book, John. The book.
The key to cracking the cipher.

950
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:38,920
Soo Lin used it to do this. Whilst
we were running around the gallery,

951
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:42,440
she started to translate the code.
It must be on her desk.

952
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:45,600
Taxi!

953
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,040
ANGRY VOICE

954
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:48,720
Entschuldigen Sie, bitte.

955
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,720
Ja, danke(!)

956
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,480

957
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:04,880
INAUDIBLE

958
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:16,680
A book that everybody would own.

959
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,480
Please, wait!

960
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:23,160
Bitte!

961
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:27,240

962
01:12:27,240 --> 01:12:28,880
Hey, du, was machst du?

963
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:31,080
Minute!
Gib mir doch mein Buch zuruck!

964
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:35,400
Yeah. No, absolutely.

965
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:38,440
I mean, a quiet night in
is just what the doctor ordered.

966
01:12:40,240 --> 01:12:45,360
I mean, I love to go out of an
evening and wrestle a few Chinese
gangsters generally,

967
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,480
but a girl can get too much. OK.

968
01:12:51,120 --> 01:12:53,760
Er, shall we get a takeaway?

969
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,320
Yeah.

970
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,520
Page 15, entry 1...

971
01:12:58,520 --> 01:13:00,600
Page 15, entry 1.

972
01:13:03,640 --> 01:13:05,640
Dead man.

973
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:08,360
You were threatening to kill them.

974
01:13:08,360 --> 01:13:10,080
That's the first cipher.

975
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,800
9... 0... 15...

976
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:18,240
er, 15 and 36.

977
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,440
36, 39, 39...

978
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,200

979
01:13:23,200 --> 01:13:24,680
9...

980
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,560
"Nine", "mill", "for"...

981
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:43,240
KNOCK AT DOOR

982
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:45,600
Blimey, that was quick.
I'll just pop down.

983
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,240
Do you want me to lay the table?

984
01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:51,320
Um...eat off trays? Yeah.

985
01:13:53,640 --> 01:13:56,120
70...35...

986
01:13:59,480 --> 01:14:00,760
Jade...

987
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,720
Jade.

988
01:14:05,160 --> 01:14:07,240
Sorry to keep you.
How much do you want?

989
01:14:07,240 --> 01:14:08,920
Do you have it? What?

990
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:12,480
Do you have the treasure?
I don't understand.

991
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,200
MUTTERS

992
01:14:25,280 --> 01:14:30,120
"Nine mill for Jade pin.

01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:47,000
HOLMES: John! John, I've got it.

997
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:50,880
The cipher, the book. It's the
London A-Z that they're us...

998
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:11,960
WOMAN: A book is like
a magic garden,

999
01:15:11,960 --> 01:15:14,360
carried in your pocket.

1000
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:32,320
Chinese proverb, Mr Holmes.
I'm...

1001
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:33,880
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.

1002
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,400
Forgive me
if I do not take your word for it.

1003
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:39,880
Ow!

1004
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,080
Debit card, name of...

1005
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,240
S Holmes.

1006
01:15:46,240 --> 01:15:47,360
Take my card.

1007
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,480
Yes, that's not actually mine.
He lent that to me.

1008
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:56,440
And a cheque for £5,000 made out
in the name of Mr Sherlock Holmes.

1009
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:59,880
Yeah, he gave me that to look after.

1010
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:03,880
Tickets from the theatre
collected by you, name of Holmes.

1011
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,120
Yes, OK.

1012
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,560
What's the name?
Er, Holmes.

1013
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:08,400
I realise what this looks like.

1014
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,040
But I'm not him.

1015
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:13,680
We heard it from your own mouth.
What?

1016
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:17,760
"I am Sherlock Holmes
and I always work alone."

1017
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,800
Because no-one else can compete with
my massive intellect.

1018
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:22,960
Did I really say that?

1019
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:31,120
I suppose there's no use me trying
to persuade you I was doing
an impression.

1020
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,600
I am Shan.

1021
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,360
You're... You're Shan?

1022
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:42,760
Three times we tried to kill you
and your companion, Mr Holmes.

1023
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:46,400
What does it tell you when an
assassin cannot shoot straight?

1024
01:16:47,760 --> 01:16:49,000
GUN COCKS

1025
01:16:59,160 --> 01:17:01,400
GUN CLICKS

1026
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,720
It tells you
that they're not really trying.

1027
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,120
Tramway.

1028
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,240
There.

1029
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:33,520
Not blank bullets now. OK.

1030
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:36,560
If we wanted to kill you, Mr Holmes,
we would have done it by now.

1031
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,360
We just wanted to
make you inquisitive.

1032
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:44,240
Do you have it?
Do I have what?

1033
01:17:44,240 --> 01:17:47,760
The treasure. I don't know
what you're talking about.

1034
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:50,840
I would prefer to make certain.

1035
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,480
Everything in the West
has its price.

1036
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:03,360
And the price for her life -
information.

1037
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,480
SARAH GROANS

1038
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:12,680
(I'm sorry. I'm sorry.)

1039
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:29,920
Where's the hairpin? What?

1040
01:18:29,920 --> 01:18:33,840
The Empress pin
valued at £9 million sterling?

1041
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:36,120
We already had a buyer in the West

1042
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,360
and then one of our people
was greedy, he took it,

1043
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:41,640
brought it back to London, and you,
Mr Holmes, have been searching.

1044
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:44,920
Please, please. Listen to me.
I'm not...

1045
01:18:44,920 --> 01:18:48,240
I'm not Sherlock Holmes.
You have to believe me.

1046
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,080
I haven't found whatever it is
you're looking for.

1047
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:54,200
I need a volunteer from
the audience. No, please, please!

1048
01:18:54,200 --> 01:18:56,720
Ah, thank you, lady.

1049
01:18:56,720 --> 01:19:00,880
Yes, you'll do very nicely.

1050
01:19:00,880 --> 01:19:02,880
MUFFLED GROANS

1051
01:19:21,920 --> 01:19:29,360
Ladies and gentlemen, from the
distant, moonlit shores of NW1,

1052
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:33,040
we present for your pleasure,

1053
01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:39,080
Sherlock Holmes' pretty companion
in a death-defying act. Please!

1054
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:46,920
You've seen the act before.
How dull for you.

1055
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,480
You know how it ends.

1056
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:50,400
I'm not Sherlock Holmes!

1057
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:51,920
I don't believe you.

1058
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:53,840
You should, you know.

1059
01:19:53,840 --> 01:19:56,880
Sherlock Holmes
is nothing at all like him.

1060
01:19:56,880 --> 01:20:00,440
How would you describe me, John?

1061
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:04,320
Resourceful? Dynamic? Enigmatic?
Late?

1062
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,880
That's a semi-automatic.
If you fire it,

1063
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:08,720
the bullet will travel at
over 1,000 metres per second.

1064
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,240
Well?

1065
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:12,600
Well...
THUMP

1066
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,800
..the radius curvature of these
walls is nearly four metres.

1067
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:16,080
If you miss,
the bullet will ricochet.

1068
01:20:16,080 --> 01:20:17,760
Could hit anyone.

1069
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:20,680
Might even bounce off the tunnel
and hit you.

1070
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,240
WHOOSH
THUMP

1071
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:24,680
GROANS

1072
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:35,480
FOOTSTEPS RECEDE

1073
01:21:41,000 --> 01:21:42,320
It's all right.

1074
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:44,480
GRUNTS

1075
01:21:44,480 --> 01:21:46,800
You're going to be all right.
It's over now.

1076
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,400
Don't worry.

1077
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:57,440
Next date won't be like this.

1078
01:22:11,480 --> 01:22:13,880
We'll just slip off. No need
to mention us in your report.

1079
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:17,000
Mr Holmes... I have high hopes
for you, Inspector.

1080
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,320
A glittering career.

1081
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:21,360
I go where you point me.

1082
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:24,880
Exactly.

1083
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:31,400
POURING LIQUID

1084
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:34,080
WATSON: Ta.

1085
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,840
So, nine million. Million.

1086
01:22:35,840 --> 01:22:41,200
Million, yes. Nine million for
Jade pin dragon den black tramway.

1087
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:43,680
An instruction
to all their London operatives.

1088
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,360
A message.
What they were trying to reclaim.

1089
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:48,200
What, a jade pin?
Worth £9 million.

1090
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,520
Bring it to the Tramway,
their London hideout.

1091
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:53,120
Hang on. A hairpin worth £9 million?

1092
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,360
Apparently. Why so much?

1093
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,520
Depends who owned it.

1094
01:23:03,160 --> 01:23:05,480
Two operatives based in London.

1095
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,360
They travel over to Dalian
to smuggle those vases.

1096
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,720
One of them helps himself
to something, a little hairpin.

1097
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,200
Worth £9 million.
Eddie Van Coon was the thief,

1098
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,200
he stole the treasure
when he was in China.

1099
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:17,880
How do you know it was Van Coon,
not Lukis?

1100
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:20,960
Even the killer didn't know that.
Because of the soap.

1101
01:23:28,960 --> 01:23:30,960
PHONE RINGS

1102
01:23:32,920 --> 01:23:35,480
Amanda?
HOLMES: He brought you a present.

1103
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:36,960
Oh, hello.

1104
01:23:36,960 --> 01:23:39,640
A little gift
when he came back from China.

1105
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:44,040
How do you know that?
You weren't just his PA, were you?

1106
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:45,640
Someone's been gossiping.

1107
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,480
No. Then I don't understand why...

1108
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:49,440
Scented hand soap in his apartment.

1109
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:52,880
300ml of it. Bottle almost finished.

1110
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:57,880
Sorry...? I don't think Eddie
Van Coon was the type of chap
to buy himself hand soap,

1111
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:00,000
not unless he had
a lady coming over.

1112
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,600
And it's the same brand as that
hand cream there on your desk.

1113
01:24:04,720 --> 01:24:08,240
Look, it wasn't serious between us.

1114
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,840
It was over in a flash,
it couldn't last. He was my boss.

1115
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:15,440
What happened? Why did you end it?

1116
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:20,440
I thought he didn't appreciate me.

1117
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:22,240
Took me for granted.

1118
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,560
Stood me up once too often.

1119
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,360
We'd plan to go away for the weekend,
and then he'd just leave.

1120
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,120
Fly off to China
at a moment's notice.

1121
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,360
And he brought you a present
from abroad to say sorry.

1122
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,080
Can I just have a look at it?

1123
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:48,040
He really climbed up
onto the balcony?

1124
01:24:48,040 --> 01:24:51,120
Nail a plank across the window
and all your problems are over.

1125
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,040
Thanks.

1126
01:24:55,040 --> 01:24:58,480
He said he bought it
in a street market.

1127
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:01,400
Oh, I don't think that's true.
I think he pinched it.

1128
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,920
Yeah, that's Eddie.

1129
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,360
Didn't know its value,
just thought it would suit you.

1130
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,280
Oh? What's it worth?

1131
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:12,480
£9 million.

1132
01:25:15,480 --> 01:25:16,720
Oh, my God.

1133
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:18,280
Oh, my God!

1134
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,400
Nine million?!

1135
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,080
Over 1,000 years old

1136
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,240
and it's sitting on her bedside table
every night.

1137
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:42,280
He didn't know its value. Didn't
know why they were chasing him.

1138
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,520
Should've just got her a lucky cat.

1139
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:52,920
You mind, don't you? What?

1140
01:25:52,920 --> 01:25:55,880
That she escaped. General Shan.

1141
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,840
It's not enough
that we got her two henchmen.

1142
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,640
Must be a vast network, John.

1143
01:25:59,640 --> 01:26:01,400
Thousands of operatives.

1144
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:03,920
You and I,
we barely scratched the surface.

1145
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,040
You cracked the code though,
Sherlock.

1146
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:08,880
And maybe Dimmock can track down
all of them now he knows it.

1147
01:26:08,880 --> 01:26:13,320
No. No, I crack this code,

1148
01:26:13,320 --> 01:26:17,400
all the smugglers have to do
is pick up another book.

1149
01:26:37,920 --> 01:26:40,360
SIREN BLARES

1150
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,480
Without you...

1151
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,480
without your assistance,

1152
01:26:48,480 --> 01:26:51,760
we would not have found
passage into London.

1153
01:26:55,200 --> 01:26:57,200
You have my thanks.

1154
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:10,040
We did not anticipate...

1155
01:27:11,760 --> 01:27:14,640
We did not know this man would come.

1156
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:19,160
This Sherlock Holmes.

1157
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:26,240
And now your safety is compromised.

1158
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,640
I will not reveal your identity.
