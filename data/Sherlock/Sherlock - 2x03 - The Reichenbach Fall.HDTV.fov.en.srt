00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:03,800
THUNDER RUMBLES 

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,040
Why today? 

3
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,600
- Do you want to hear me say it? 
- 18 months since our last appointment. 

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,880
You read the papers? 

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,440
Sometimes... 

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,920
And you watch telly? 

7
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,640
You know why I'm here. 

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,920
I'm here because... 

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,400
What happened, John? 

10
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,080
Sherl... 

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,840
You need to get it out. 

12
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:59,360
My best friend... 

13
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,760
Sherlock Holmes... 

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,520
..is dead. 

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,080
Falls Of The Reichenbach. Turner's masterpiece. 

16
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,840
Thankfully recovered, 

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,800
owing to the prodigious talent of Mr Sherlock Holmes. 

18
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,520
APPLAUSE 

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,240
A small token of our gratitude. 

20
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,640
Diamond cufflinks... All my cuffs have buttons. 

21
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,960
- He means thank you. 
- Do I? 

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,800
- Just say it. 
- Thank you. 

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,240
Hang on. 

24
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:13,600
Back together with my family, after my terrifying ordeal. 

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:17,880
And we have one person to thank for my deliverance... 

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,040
Sherlock Holmes. 

27
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,920
APPLAUSE 

28
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,280
- Tie pin. I don't wear ties. 
- Shhh. 

29
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,400
Peter Ricoletti... Number one on Interpol's most wanted list since 1982. 

30
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,760
We got him, and there's one person we have to thank for giving us the decisive leads. 

31
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,400
With all his customary diplomacy and tact. 

32
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,000
- Sarcasm. 
- Yes. 

33
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,560
We all chipped in. 

34
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,880
Oh... 

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,520
Put the hat on. Put the hat on. 

36
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,800
Yes, Sherlock, put it on. 

37
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,160
Just get it over with. 

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
"Boffin!" 

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,560
"Boffin Sherlock Holmes!" 

40
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,840
Everybody gets one. 

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,320
- One what? 
- Tabloid nickname. 

42
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,160
- SuBo, Nasty Nick. I'll probably get one soon. 
- Page five, column six, first sentence. 

43
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:26,200
Why is it always the hat photograph?! 

44
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,880
- "Bachelor John Watson." 
- What kind of hat is it? 
- What are they implying?! 

45
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,880
- Is it a cap? Why has it got two fronts? 
- It's a deerstalker. 

46
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:37,520
- "Frequently seen in the company of bachelor John Watson." 
- What are you going to do, throw it? 

47
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,200
- "Confirmed bachelor John Watson." 
- A death frisbee! 
- This is too much, 

48
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,960
- we need to be more careful. 
- It's got flaps. Ear flaps, it's an ear hat, John. 

49
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,760
What do you mean, more careful? 

50
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,000
I mean, this isn't a deerstalker now, it's a Sherlock Holmes hat. 

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,840
I mean, you're not exactly a private detective any more. 

52
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,040
- You're this far from famous. 
- Oh, it'll pass. 

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:03,440
It better pass. The press will turn, Sherlock, they always turn and they'll turn on you. 

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,240
- It really bothers you. 
- What? 
- What people say. 
- Yes. 

55
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,360
About me? why would it upset YOU? 

56
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,640
Just try to keep a low profile. Find yourself a little case this week. 

57
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,880
Stay out of the news. 

58
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,240
MOBILE BLEEPS 

59
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,960
That's your phone. 

60
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,200
Hmm, it keeps doing that. 

61
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,680
So, did you just talk to him for a really long time? 

62
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,800
Oh, Henry Fishguard never committed suicide. 

63
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,280
Bow Street runners missed everything. 

64
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,800
- Pressing case, is it? 
- They're all pressing until they're solved. 

65
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Put your key back please. Thank you. 

66
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,280
Excuse me, sir. 

67
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,040
Any metal objects, keys, mobile phones? 

68
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,880
You can go through. 

69
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,080
Thank you. 

70
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,520
Fancy a cuppa then, mate? 

71
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, why not? 

72
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,040
Gilts at seven. 

73
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,960
Dutch Telecoms in free-fall. Thank you, Harvey. 

74
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,120
What are you saying? 

75
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,000
Refuse them all parole and bring back the rope? 

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,600
Let's begin. 

77
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,320
ALARM SOUNDS 

78
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,840
This is an emergency. Please leave. 

79
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,400
Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave. 

80
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,840
DOOR BANGS 

81
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,200
Sir, there's been a break-in. 

82
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,240
Not our division. 

83
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,680
You'll want it. 

84
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,640
ALARM SOUNDS 

85
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,440
The vault! 

86
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,160
Hacked into the Tower of bloody London's security?! How?! 

87
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,160
MOBILE RINGS 

88
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,800
- Tell them we're on our way! 
- There's been another one, another break-in. 

89
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,280
Bank of England! 

90
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,240
ALARM SOUNDS 

91
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,320
Sir! Security's down, sir. It's failing. 

92
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,840
What is it now? 

93
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,600
Pentonville Prison. 

94
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,320
Oh no! 

95
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,640
POLICE SIRENS 

96
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
No rush. 

97
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,080
MOBILE BLEEPS 

98
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,720
I'll get it, shall I? 

99
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,880
- Here. 
- Not now, I'm busy. 

100
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,720
- Sherlock... 
- Not now! 
- He's back. 

101
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:59,680
That glass is tougher than anything. 

102
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:03,480
Not tougher than crystallised carbon. He used a diamond. 

103
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,200
# Oh, sinnerman, where you gonna run to? 

104
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,160
# Sinnerman, where you gonna run to? 

105
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,160
# Where you gonna run to? 

106
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,440
# All on that day 

107
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,520
# Well, I run to the rock... # 

108
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
- Ready? 
- Yes. 

109
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,200
- Stand back. Stand back. 
- Mr Holmes. Mr Holmes. 

110
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,560
- Let them through. 
- Thank you. Get in. 

111
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,240
# Oh, Lord... 

112
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,760
# Please help me, Lord 

113
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,400
# Don't you see me praying 

114
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,960
# Don't you see me down here praying 

115
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,040
# But the Lord said 

116
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,760
# Go to the devil The Lord said 

117
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,240
# Go to the devil 

118
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,080
# He said Go to the devil 

119
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,600
# All on that day 

120
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,000
# So I ran to the devil 

121
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,920
# He was waiting... # 

122
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,480
- Remember... 
- Yes. 

123
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,360
- Remember... 
- Yes. 

124
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,120
- Remember what they told you. Don't try to be clever. 
- No. 

125
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,040
- Please, keep it simple and brief. 
- God forbid the star witness at the trial should appear intelligent. 

126
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,440
Intelligent, fine. Let's give "smart-arse" a wide berth. 

127
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,640
- I'll just be myself. 
- Are you listening to me(?) 

128
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,760
Today, outside the Old Bailey... 

129
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,160
- This is the trial of the century... 
- The trial of James Moriarty... 

130
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,520
James Moriarty, earlier today accused of... 

131
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,520
..attempting to steal the Crown Jewels. 

132
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,760
At the Old Bailey we have Reichenbach hero Sherlock Holmes... 

133
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,040
Would you mind slipping your hand into my pocket? 

134
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,280
Thanks. 

135
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,320
# It was boiling, I ran to the sea 

136
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
# It was boiling I ran to the sea... # 

137
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,240
Crown v Moriarty, please proceed to Court 10. 

138
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,920
You're him. 

139
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,560
- Wrong toilet. 
- I'm a big fan. 
- Evidently. 

140
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,680
I read your cases, follow them all. 

141
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,600
Sign my shirt, would you? 

142
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,400
- There are two types of fans. 
- Oh? 

143
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,360
- Catch me before I kill again, Type A. 
- Uh-huh. 

144
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:14,920
- What's Type B? 
- Your bedroom's just a taxi ride away. 
- Hmm. 

145
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:16,280
Guess which one I am? 

146
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,280
- Neither. 
- Really? 
- No, you're not a fan at all. 

147
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:25,600
Those marks on your forearm, edge of a desk. 

148
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,480
You've been typing in a hurry, probably, pressure on, facing a deadline. 

149
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,000
That all? 

150
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,240
There's an ink smudge on your wrist, a bulge in your jacket pocket. 

151
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,520
- Bit of a giveaway? 
- The smudge is deliberate, to see if I'm as good as they say I am. 

152
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,800
Hmm. Oil-based, used in newspaper print. 

153
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,720
- But drawn on with an index finger, your finger. 
- Hmm. 

154
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,640
Journalist. Unlikely you get your hands dirty at the press. 

155
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,080
- You put that there to test me. 
- Wow! I'm liking you. 

156
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,600
I'd make a great feature, "Sherlock Holmes, the man beneath the hat". 

157
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,320
Kitty... 

158
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,720
Riley. Pleased to meet you. 

159
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,600
I'm saving you the job of asking. I won't give you an interview. No, I don't want the money. 

160
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,000
You and John Watson, just platonic? Can I put you down for a "no" there as well(?) 

161
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,320
There's all sorts of gossip in the press about you. 

162
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,160
Sooner or later, you're going to need someone on your side. 

163
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,440
Someone to set the record straight. 

164
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,400
You think you're the girl for that job, do you? 

165
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm smart and you can trust me... 

166
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,960
..totally. 

167
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:36,680
Smart? OK, investigative journalist. 

168
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,800
Good. Well, look at me and tell me what you see. 

169
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,280
If you're that skilful, you don't need an interview, 

170
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,440
you can just read what you need. 

171
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,880
No? OK, my turn. 

172
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,200
I see someone who's waiting for their first scoop, so their editor will notice them. 

173
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:01,520
You're wearing an expensive skirt, that's been rehemmed twice. Only posh skirt you've got. 

174
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:05,360
Your nails, you can't afford to do them that often. I see someone who's hungry, 

175
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:10,280
I don't see smart. I don't see trustworthy. I'll give you a quote. if you like. Three little words. 

176
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,360
You repel me. 

177
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,520
- "A consulting criminal." 
- Yes. 

178
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:34,960
Your words. Can you expand on that answer? 

179
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,440
- James Moriarty is for hire. 
- A tradesman? 

180
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,640
- Yes. 
- But not the sort who'd fix your heating? 

181
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,680
No, the sort who'd plant a bomb or stage an assassination. 

182
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,240
But I'm sure he'd make a decent job of your boiler. 

183
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,800
Would you describe him as... 

184
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,280
- Leading. 
- What? 
- You're leading the witness. 

185
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,760
- He'll object and the judge'll uphold. 
- Mr Holmes. 

186
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,560
Ask me how, HOW would I describe him? 

187
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,320
What opinion have I formed of him? Do they not teach you this? 

188
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,520
Mr Holmes, we are fine without your help. 

189
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,480
HOW would you describe this man, his character? 

190
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,960
First mistake. 

191
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,800
James Moriarty isn't a man at all. 

192
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,480
He's a spider. 

193
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:17,440
A spider at the centre of a web, a criminal web with a thousand threads 

194
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,440
and he knows precisely how each and every single one of them dances. 

195
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:25,040
SHE CLEARS THROAT 

196
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,360
- And how long...? 
- No, no. Don't, don't do that. 

197
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,080
- That's really not a good question. 
- Mr Holmes! 

198
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,880
How long have I known him? Not your best line of enquiry. 

199
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,120
We met twice, five minutes in total. 

200
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,440
I pulled a gun, he tried to blow me up. 

201
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,600
I felt we had a special something. 

202
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,040
Miss Sorrel, are you seriously claiming this man is an expert? 

203
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,080
After knowing the accused for just five minutes? 

204
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:50,120
Two minutes would have made me an expert, five was ample. 

205
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,280
- Mr Holmes, that's a matter for the jury. 
- Oh, really? 

206
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,440
One librarian, two teachers, 

207
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,720
two high-pressure jobs, probably the City. 

208
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,400
- The foreman's a medical secretary, trained abroad, judging by her shorthand. 
- Mr Holmes? 

209
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,520
Seven are married, two are having an affair with each other. 

210
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,960
- Oh, they've just had tea and biscuits. Would you like to know who ate the wafer? 
- Mr Holmes! 

211
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:16,720
You've been called here to answer Miss Sorrel's questions, 

212
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,360
not to give us a display of your intellectual prowess. 

213
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:24,080
Keep your answers brief and to the point. 

214
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,240
Anything else will be treated as contempt. 

215
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,320
Do you think you could survive for just a few minutes... 

216
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:30,800
WITHOUT SHOWING OFF?! 

217
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
CELL DOOR SLAMS 

218
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,400
What did I say? I said don't get clever. 

219
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,480
- I can't just turn it on and off like a tap. Well? 
- Well, what? 

220
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:01,000
You were there for the whole thing, up in the gallery, start to finish. 

221
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,600
Like you said it would be - sat on his backside, never even stirred. 

222
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,760
Moriarty is not mounting any defence. 

223
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,680
Bank of England, Tower of London, Pentonville. 

224
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,280
Three of the most secure places in the country 

225
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,360
and six weeks ago, Moriarty breaks in, 

226
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,080
no-one knows how or why. 

227
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:19,880
- All we know is... 
- He ended up in custody. 

228
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,960
- Don't do that. 
- Do what? 

229
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,320
- The look. 
- Look? 
- You're doing the look again. 
- Well, I can't see it, can I? 

230
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,800
It's my face. 

231
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,400
Yes and you're doing a "We both know what's really going on here" face. 

232
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,480
- We do. 
- No, I don't, which is why I find the face so annoying. 

233
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,840
If Moriarty wanted the jewels, he'd have them. 

234
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,760
If he wanted the prisoners freed, they'd be on the streets. 

235
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,400
The reason he's still in a prison cell is cos he chose to be there. 

236
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,200
Somehow this is part of his scheme. 

237
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:01,680
Mr Crayhill, can we have your first witness? 

238
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,080
Your Honour, we're not calling any witnesses. 

239
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,600
I don't follow. 

240
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,080
You've entered a plea of not guilty. 

241
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,960
Nevertheless, my client is offering no evidence. 

242
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,720
The defence...rests. 

243
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:31,600
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, James Moriarty stands accused... 

244
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,080
of several counts of attempted burglary. 

245
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,760
Crimes which, if he's found guilty, 

246
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,680
will elicit a very long custodial sentence, 

247
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,400
and yet...his legal team... 

248
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,160
has chosen to offer no evidence whatsoever 

249
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,240
to support their plea. 

250
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,840
I find myself in the unusual position 

251
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,960
of recommending a verdict wholeheartedly. 

252
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,880
You must find him guilty. 

253
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,360
Guilty. 

254
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,280
You must find him guilty. 

255
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,040
DOOR SLAMS 

256
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,400
- They're coming back. 
- That's six minutes. 

257
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,360
Surprised it took them that long, to be honest. 

258
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,440
There's a queue for the loo! 

259
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,320
Have you reached a verdict on which you all agree? 

260
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,240
PHONE RINGS 

261
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,280
Not guilty, they found him not guilty. 

262
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:51,280
No defence and Moriarty's walked free. 

263
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,600
Sherlock? 

264
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,240
Are you listening? He's out, you know he'll be coming after you. Sherl... 

265
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:14,360
VIOLIN PLAYS 

266
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,680
STAIRS CREAK 

267
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,600
MUSIC STOPS 

268
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,400
VIOLIN PLAYS AGAIN 

269
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,480
DOOR CREAKS 

270
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,880
Most people knock. 

271
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,800
But then, you're not most people, I suppose. 

272
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,960
Kettle's just boiled. 

273
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,640
Johann Sebastian would be appalled. 

274
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,800
- May I? 
- Please. 

275
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,400
You know when he was on his deathbed, Bach, 

276
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,280
he heard his son at the piano playing one of his...pieces. 

277
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,160
The boy stopped before he got to the end. 

278
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:24,320
The dying man jumped out of bed, ran to the piano and finished it. 

279
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,640
- Couldn't cope with an unfinished melody. 
- Neither can you, that's why you've come. 

280
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,720
- Be honest, you're a tiny bit pleased. 
- What, with the verdict? 

281
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,960
With me, back on the streets. 

282
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,960
Every fairy tale needs a good old-fashioned villain. 

283
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,120
You need me or you're nothing. 

284
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,960
Because we're just alike, you and I, 

285
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,480
except you're boring. 

286
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,840
You're on the side of the angels. 

287
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,680
You got to the jury, of course. 

288
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,920
I got into the Tower of London, 

289
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,320
you think I can't worm my way into 12 hotel rooms? 

290
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,520
Cable network. 

291
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:05,760
Every hotel bedroom has a personalised TV screen. 

292
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,960
And every person has their pressure point. 

293
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,240
Someone that they want to protect from harm. 

294
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,560
Easy peasy. 

295
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,560
So how are you going to do it? 

296
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,760
Burn me? 

297
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:25,040
Ah, that's the problem, the final problem. 

298
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,520
Have you worked out what it is yet? 

299
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,440
What's the final problem? 

300
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,200
I did tell you... but did you listen? 

301
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,000
How hard do you find it, having to say "I don't know"? 

302
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,280
- I don't know. 
- Oh, that's clever, very clever, awfully clever. 

303
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,960
Speaking of clever, have you told your little friends yet? 

304
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,200
Told them what? 

305
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:05,240
- Why I broke into all those places and never took anything? 
- No. 

306
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,280
- But you understand? 
- Obviously. 
- Off you go, then. 

307
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:11,520
- Tell you what you already know? 
- No, prove that you know it. 

308
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,800
- You didn't take anything because you don't need to. 
- Good. 

309
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,280
- You'll never need to take anything ever again. 
- Very good, because? 

310
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,560
Because nothing in the Bank of England, 

311
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,960
the Tower of London or Pentonville Prison could possibly match 

312
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,640
the value of the key that could get you into all three. 

313
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:31,680
I can open any door anywhere with a few tiny lines of computer code. 

314
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,000
No such thing as a private bank account now, they're all mine. 

315
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,160
No such thing as secrecy, I OWN secrecy. 

316
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,320
Nuclear codes? 

317
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,840
I could blow up NATO in alphabetical order. 

318
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:46,960
In a world of locked rooms, the man with the key is king. 

319
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,040
And honey, you should see me in a crown. 

320
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,360
You were advertising all through the trial, 

321
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,560
you were showing the world what you can do. 

322
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,040
And you were helping. 

323
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,840
Big client list - rogue governments, intelligence communities, 

324
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,480
terrorist cells. 

325
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,440
They all want me. 

326
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,640
Suddenly, I'm Mr Sex. 

327
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,440
If you can break any bank, what do you care about the highest bidder? 

328
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,280
I don't, I just like to watch them all competing. 

329
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,080
"Daddy loves me the best." Aren't ordinary people adorable? 

330
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:23,560
Well, you know, you've got John. I should get myself a live-in one. 

331
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:27,280
- Why are you doing all of this? 
- It must be so funny. 

332
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,720
You don't want money or power, not really. 

333
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,120
What is it all for? 

334
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,840
I want to solve the problem. 

335
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,560
Our problem. 

336
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,040
The final problem. 

337
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:47,280
It's going to start very soon, Sherlock...the fall. 

338
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,880
HE WHISTLES 

339
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,720
But don't be scared, falling is just like flying, 

340
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,440
except there's a more permanent destination. 

341
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,640
Never liked riddles. 

342
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,600
Learn to. 

343
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,160
Because I owe you a fall, Sherlock. 

344
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,520
I...owe...you. 

345
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,080
KEYPAD BLEEPS 

346
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,720
Er, excuse me, I'm looking for Mycroft Holmes? 

347
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,960
Would you happen to know if he's around at all? 

348
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,400
Can you not hear me? 

349
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,200
Yes, all right. Anyone? 

350
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,520
Anyone at all know... 

351
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,040
where Mycroft Holmes is, I've been asked to meet him here? 

352
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:13,000
No takers, right. Am I invisible, can you actually see me? 

353
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:17,560
Ah, thanks, gents. I've been asked to meet Mycroft Holmes. What the hell?! 

354
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,440
MUFFLED CRIES FROM JOHN 

355
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,440
Tradition, John, our traditions define us. 

356
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,600
So total silence is traditional, is it? 

357
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,440
You can't even say pass the sugar? 

358
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,600
Three-quarters of the diplomatic service 

359
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,920
and half the government front bench all sharing one tea trolley, 

360
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,600
it's for the best, believe me. 

361
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:38,040
We don't want a repeat of...1972. 

362
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:40,840
- But we can talk in here. 
- You read this stuff? 

363
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,280
- Caught my eye. 
- Mm-hm. 

364
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,600
Saturday, they're doing a big expose. 

365
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,400
I'd love to know where she got her information. 

366
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,360
Someone called Brook. Recognise the name? 

367
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,240
School friend, maybe? 

368
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,840
- HE LAUGHS 
- Of Sherlock's? 

369
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,280
But that's not why I asked you here. 

370
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,760
- Who's that? 
- Don't know? 
- No. 
- Never seen his face before? 

371
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,160
- Um... 
- He's taken a flat in Baker Street, two doors down from you. 

372
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:16,320
Hm, I was thinking of doing a drinks thing for the neighbours. 

373
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,880
I'm not sure you'll want to. 

374
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,640
Sulejmani, Albanian hit squad, expertly trained killer, 

375
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,240
living less than 20 feet from your front door. 

376
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,360
Well, it's a great location. Jubilee line's handy. 

377
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,680
- John... 
- What's it got to do with me? 

378
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,720
Dyachenko. Ludmila. 

379
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,120
Oh... 

380
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,080
- Actually, I think I have seen her. 
- Russian killer. 

381
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,360
She's taken the flat opposite. 

382
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,560
OK. 

383
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,800
I'm sensing a pattern here. 

384
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,560
In fact, four top international assassins relocate 

385
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,440
to within spitting distance of 221b. 

386
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,640
- Anything you'd care to share with me? 
- JOHN LAUGHS 

387
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,320
- I'm moving? 
- It's not hard to guess the common denominator, is it? 

388
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,040
You think this is Moriarty? 

389
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,640
He promised Sherlock he'd come back. 

390
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:07,120
- If this was Moriarty, we'd be dead already. 
- If not Moriarty, then who? 

391
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,840
Why don't you talk to Sherlock, if you're so concerned about him? 

392
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:15,480
Oh, God, don't tell me. 

393
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,360
Too much history between us, John. 

394
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,560
Old scores, resentments. 

395
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,120
Nicked all his Smurfs? Broke his Action Man? 

396
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,880
(Finished.) 

397
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,280
We both know what's coming, John. 

398
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:36,560
Moriarty is obsessed, he's sworn to destroy his only rival. 

399
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,440
So you want me to watch out for your brother because he won't accept your help? 

400
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,600
If it's not too much trouble? 

401
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,800
DOOR BANGS 

402
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,720
- Excuse me. 
- Sorry. 

403
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,400
- Sherlock, something weird... What's going on? 
- Kidnapping. 
- Rufus Bruhl. 

404
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,920
- The ambassador to the US. 
- He's in Washington, isn't he? 

405
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,000
Not him, his children. Max and Claudette, age seven and nine. 

406
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,840
- They're at St Aldates. 
- Posh boarding place in Surrey. 

407
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,880
School broke up, the boarders went home. 

408
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,800
- A few kids remained, including those two. 
- The kids have vanished. 

409
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,440
- The ambassador's asked for you personally. 
- The Reichenbach hero. 

410
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,920
Isn't it great to be working with a celebrity? 

411
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,400
We shouldn't need to keep you for much longer. Thank you. 

412
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:19,880
- It's all right. 
- Miss Mackenzie, House Mistress. Go easy. 

413
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,520
Miss Mackenzie, you're in charge of pupil welfare, 

414
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,840
yet you left this place wide open last night. 

415
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,000
What are you, an idiot, a drunk or a criminal?! Quickly, tell me! 

416
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,720
All the doors and windows were properly bolted. 

417
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,360
No-one, not even me, went into their room last night. 

418
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,480
- You have to believe me! 
- I do, I just wanted you to speak quickly. 

419
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,960
Miss Mackenzie will need to breath into a bag now. 

420
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,480
SHE SOBS 

421
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:50,200
Six grand a term, you'd expect them to keep the kids safe for you. 

422
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,960
You said the other kids had all left on their holidays. 

423
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,400
They were the only two sleeping on this floor. 

424
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,640
There's absolutely no sign of a break-in. 

425
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:01,160
The intruder must have been hidden inside some place. 

426
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,760
Show me where the brother slept. 

427
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,480
The boy sleeps there every night. 

428
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,320
Gazing at the only light source outside in the corridor. 

429
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,800
He'd recognise every shape, every outline, 

430
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,200
the silhouette of everyone who came to the door. 

431
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,200
- OK, so? 
- So if someone approaches the door who he doesn't recognise, 

432
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,080
an intruder, maybe he can even see the outline of a weapon. 

433
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,320
What would he do? 

434
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,240
In the precious few seconds before they came into the room, 

435
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,720
how would he use them if not to cry out? 

436
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,600
This little boy, this particular little boy, 

437
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:05,080
who reads all of those spy books, what would he do? 

438
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,240
He'd leave a sign? 

439
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,120
HE SNIFFS 

440
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,120
Get Anderson! 

441
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,720
Linseed oil. 

442
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,600
- Not much use, it doesn't lead us to the kidnapper. 
- Brilliant, Anderson. 

443
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:31,400
- Really? 
- Yes, brilliant impression of an idiot. 

444
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,840
Floor. 

445
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:38,760
- He...made a trail for us. 
- The boy was made to walk ahead of them. 

446
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,560
- On what, tiptoe? 
- Indicates anxiety. 

447
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,000
Gun held to his head. 

448
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,480
The girl was pulled beside him, dragged sideways. 

449
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,080
He had his left arm cradled about her neck. 

450
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,520
That's the end of it, we don't know where they went from here. 

451
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,720
Tells us nothing after all. 

452
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,240
You're right, Anderson, nothing. 

453
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,960
Except his shoe size, his height, his gait, his walking pace. 

454
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,440
SHERLOCK LAUGHS 

455
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,960
- Having fun? 
- Starting to. 

456
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,920
Maybe don't do the smiling. Kidnapped children? 

457
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,760
How could he get past the CCTV? If all the doors were locked. 

458
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,840
He walked in when they weren't locked. 

459
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,720
But a stranger can't just walk into a school like that. 

460
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,280
Anyone can walk in anywhere if they pick the right moment. 

461
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,760
Yesterday, end of term, parents milling around, chauffeurs, staff. 

462
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,800
What's one more stranger among that lot? 

463
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,920
He was waiting for them. 

464
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,120
All he had to do was find a place to hide. 

465
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,240
Molly! 

466
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:06,400
- Hello, I'm just going out. 
- No, you're not. 
- I've got a lunch date. 

467
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,040
- Cancel it, have lunch with me. 
- What? 
- I need your help. 

468
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,680
One of your old boyfriends, we're tracking him down. 

469
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,480
- He's been naughty. 
- Moriarty? 
- Of course it's Moriarty! 

470
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,480
Jim wasn't my boyfriend, we went out three times. I ended it. 

471
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:22,440
Then he stole the Crown Jewels, broke into the Bank of England and organised a prison break. 

472
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:27,200
For the sake of law and order, I suggest you avoid all future attempts at a relationship, Molly. 

473
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:34,240
Oil, John. The oil in the kidnapper's footprint. 

474
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,120
It'll lead us to Moriarty. 

475
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:39,840
All the chemical traces on his shoe have been preserved. 

476
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:44,640
The sole of the shoe is like a passport. If we're lucky, we'll see everything he's been up to. 

477
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,960
I need that analysis. 

478
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,800
Alkaline. 

479
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,800
- Thank you, John. 
- Molly. 
- Yes. 

480
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,680
I...O...U. 

481
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,680
Glycerol molecule. 

482
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,920
- HE SIGHS 
- What are you? 

483
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,080
What did you mean, IOU? 

484
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,280
You said IOU. 

485
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,720
- You were muttering it while you were working. 
- Nothing, mental note. 

486
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,280
You're a bit like my dad. He's dead. No, sorry. 

487
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,400
Molly, please don't feel the need to make conversation, it's really not your area. 

488
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,240
When he was dying, he was always cheerful, he was lovely, 

489
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,200
except when he thought no-one could see. 

490
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,040
- I saw him once, he looked sad. 
- Molly. 

491
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:09,160
You look sad, when you think he can't see you. 

492
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,120
Are you OK? And don't just say you are, because I know what that means, 

493
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,600
looking sad when you think no-one can see you. 

494
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,680
- You can see me. 
- I don't count. 

495
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,360
What I'm trying to say is, that if there's anything I can do, 

496
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,160
anything you need, anything at all, you can have me. 

497
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:37,800
No, I just mean, I mean, if there's anything you need, it's fine. 

498
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,840
But what can I need from you? 

499
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,440
Nothing. I don't know. 

500
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,600
You could probably say thank you, actually. 

501
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,560
Thank you? 

502
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:55,640
I'm just going to go and get some crisps. Do you want anything? 

503
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,320
It's OK, I know you don't. 

504
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,400
- Well, actually, maybe I'll... 
- I know you don't. 

505
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,080
- Sherlock? 
- Hmm? 

506
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:18,680
- This envelope that was in her trunk, there's another one. 
- What? 

507
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:23,720
On our doorstep. Found it today. Yes, and look at that. 

508
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:28,000
Look at that, exactly the same seal. 

509
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,760
- Breadcrumbs. 
- Uh-huh. It was there when I got back. 

510
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,000
A little trace of breadcrumbs. 

511
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,200
Hardback copy of Fairy Tales. 

512
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:46,960
Two children led into the forest by a wicked father, follow a little trail of breadcrumbs. 

513
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,960
That's Hansel and Gretel. What sort of kidnapper leaves clues? 

514
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,600
The sort that likes to boast, that thinks it's a game. 

515
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,840
He sat in our flat and he said these exact words to me... 

516
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,600
"All fairy tales need a good old-fashioned villain." 

517
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:05,640
- The fifth substance, it's part of the tale. The witch's house. 
- What? 

518
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:08,800
The glycerol molecule. 

519
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,720
- PGPR! 
- What's that? 
- It's used in making chocolate. 

520
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,680
This fax arrived an hour ago. 

521
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:27,440
PHONE RINGS 

522
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,280
What have you got for us? 

523
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:34,000
We need to find a place in the city where all five of these things intersect. 

524
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,240
Chalk, asphalt, brick dust, vegetation. 

525
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:40,120
- What - chocolate?! 
- I think we're looking for a disused sweet factory. 

526
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,560
We need to narrow that down. A sweet factory with asphalt? 

527
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,720
No, too general. Something more specific. 

528
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,680
Chalk, chalky clay. That's a far thinner band of geology. 

529
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,640
Brick dust? 

530
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,040
Building site. Bricks from the 1950s. 

531
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,600
There's thousands of building sites in London. 

532
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,000
- I've got people out looking. 
- So have I! 

533
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,440
Homeless network, faster than the police, 

534
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,120
far more relaxed about taking bribes. 

535
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,600
PHONES RING 

536
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,920
John. 

537
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,480
Rhododendron ponticum. Matches. 

538
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,680
- Addlestone. 
- What? 

539
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:34,960
A mile of disused factories between the river and the park, matches everything. 

540
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,400
Right, come on. Come on! 

541
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:43,200
SIRENS BLARE 

542
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,920
OK, you look over there. 

543
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,000
Look everywhere. 

544
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,480
OK, spread out, please, spread out. 

545
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,520
(Quietly, quietly!) 

546
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:07,800
This was alight moments ago. They're still here! Sweet wrappers? 

547
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:12,560
What's he been feeding you? Hansel and Gretel. 

548
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,720
HE SNIFFS 

549
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:20,760
Ugh! 

550
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,120
- Mercury. 
- What? 

551
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,760
The papers, they're painted with mercury, lethal. 

552
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,880
The more they ate... 

553
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,560
- It was killing them. 
- But it's not enough to kill them on its own. 

554
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:33,200
Taken in large enough quantities, eventually it would kill them. 

555
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,160
He didn't need to be there for the execution. 

556
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,000
Murder by remote control, he could be 1,000 miles away. 

557
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,360
The hungrier they got, the more they ate, the faster they died. Neat. 

558
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,600
- Sherlock. 
- Over here! 

559
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,880
I've got him, don't worry. 

560
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,600
Right then, the professionals are finished. 

561
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,000
If the amateurs want to go in and have their turn. 

562
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:10,120
Now remember, she's in shock and she's just seven years old, 

563
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,200
so, anything you can do to... 

564
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,600
- Not be myself? 
- Yeah, might be helpful. 

565
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,680
Claudette, I... 

566
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,520
- SHE SCREAMS 
- No, no, I know it's been hard for you. 

567
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,320
- Claudette, listen to me. 
- Out. Get out! 

568
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,000
- Makes no sense. 
- Kid's traumatised. 

569
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,080
- Something about Sherlock reminds her of the kidnapper. 
- What's she said? 

570
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:44,760
- Hasn't uttered another syllable. 
- And the boy? 
- No, he's unconscious. 

571
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,880
He's still in intensive care. 

572
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,880
Don't let it get to you, 

573
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,600
I always feel like screaming when you walk into a room. 

574
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,240
In fact, so do most people. 

575
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,440
Come on. 

576
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,000
SIREN BLARES OUTSIDE 

577
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,240
Brilliant work you did finding those kids from just a footprint, 

578
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,400
it's really amazing. 

579
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,560
Thank you. 

580
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,920
Unbelievable. 

581
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:31,480
Ah. 

582
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,680
- You OK? 
- Thinking. 

583
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,480
- This is my cab, you get the next one. 
- Why? 
- You might talk. 

584
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,200
- 'Is this chocolate?' 
- 'We're looking for a disused sweet factory.' 

585
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,920
'Get out!' 

586
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,480
'Aaaargh!' 

587
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,520
Problem? 

588
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:18,960
- TV BLARES 
- '..this stunning evening wear set from us at London Taxi Shopping. 

589
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:23,120
- Can you turn this off, please? 
- 'The set comprises of a beautiful...' 

590
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,080
Can you turn this off?! 

591
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:28,320
'Accompanied by four spangly diamond bracelets...' 

592
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:30,680
Hello. 

593
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,640
Are you ready for the story? 

594
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:36,200
This is the story of Sir Boast-a-lot. 

595
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,720
A footprint, it's all he had. 

596
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,720
A footprint. 

597
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,360
Yeah, well, you know what he's like. CSI Baker Street. 

598
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,520
Well, our boys couldn't have done it. 

599
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:52,800
- Well, that's why we need him, he's better. 
- That's one explanation. 

600
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,480
And what's the other? 

601
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,680
Sir Boast-a-lot was the bravest and cleverest knight at the round table. 

602
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:02,520
But soon the other knights began to grow tired of his stories 

603
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:05,760
about how brave he was and how many dragons he'd slain. 

604
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:12,920
And soon they began to wonder, "Are Sir Boast-a-lot's stories even true?" 

605
00:46:12,920 --> 00:46:15,000
Only he could have found that evidence. 

606
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,440
Oh, no. 

607
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:21,320
The girl screams her head off when she sees him - a man she has never seen before, 

608
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:24,000
- unless she had seen him before. 
- What's your point? 

609
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,880
You know what it is, you just don't want to think about it. 

610
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,160
So, all of the knights went to King Arthur and said, 

611
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,720
"I don't believe Sir Boast-a-lot's stories. 

612
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,880
"He's just a big old liar who makes things up to make himself look good." 

613
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,680
SHE MOUTHS 

614
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:46,240
You're not seriously suggesting he's involved, are you? 

615
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,320
We have to entertain the possibility. 

616
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,000
And then, even the King began to wonder. 

617
00:46:57,200 --> 00:47:00,760
But that wasn't the end of Sir Boast-a-lot's problem. 

618
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,080
No. 

619
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,040
That wasn't the final problem. 

620
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,560
The end. 

621
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,120
Stop the cab. 

622
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,720
Stop the cab! 

623
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:17,880
What was that?! 

624
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,960
What was that? 

625
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,000
No charge. 

626
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,840
Watch out! 

627
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:32,240
TYRES SQUEAL 

628
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:38,040
Thank you. 

629
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,720
GUNFIRE 

630
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,240
Sherlock! 

631
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,560
That is him. It's him. 

632
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,440
Sulejmani or something, Mycroft showed me his file. 

633
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,360
He's a big Albanian gangster, lives two doors down from us. 

634
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,320
- He died because I shook his hand. 
- What? 

635
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,880
He saved my life, but he couldn't touch me. Why? 

636
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,040
Four assassins living right on our doorstep. 

637
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:16,960
They haven't come here to kill me. 

638
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:18,560
They have to keep me alive. 

639
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,880
I've got something that all of them want. 

640
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,640
But if one of them approaches me... 

641
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:25,920
The others kill them before they can get it. 

642
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:31,720
All of the attention is focused on me. 

643
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:36,360
There's a surveillance web closing in on us right now. 

644
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,640
So what have you got that's so important? 

645
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,000
I need to ask about the dusting. 

646
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:45,280
Precise details, in the last week, what's been cleaned? 

647
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:49,320
- Tuesday, I did your lino. 
- No, this room, this is where we'll find it. 

648
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,280
Any break in the dust line. You can put back anything but dust. Dust is eloquent. 

649
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:54,760
(What's he on about?) 

650
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,000
Cameras, we're being watched. 

651
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:00,600
What?! Cameras? Here? 

652
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,560
- DOORBELL RINGS 
- I'm in my nightie! 

653
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,000
FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS 

654
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,400
- No, Inspector. 
- Why? 

655
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,840
- The answer's no. 
- You've not heard the question! 

656
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:28,320
You want to take me to the station. Saving you the trouble of asking. 

657
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,080
Sherlock. 

658
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,200
- The scream? 
- Yeah. 

659
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,360
Who was it? Donovan? I bet it was Donovan. 

660
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,760
"Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping?" 

661
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:38,360
Ha ha, Moriarty is smart. 

662
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:42,280
He planted that doubt in her head. That little nagging sensation. 

663
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,560
You're going to have to be strong to resist. 

664
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:47,080
You can't kill an idea, can you? 

665
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,320
Not once it's made a home...there. 

666
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,760
- Will you come? 
- One photograph, that's his next move. 

667
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,200
Moriarty's game. 

668
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,120
First the scream, then a photograph of me being taken in for questioning. 

669
00:50:01,120 --> 00:50:03,280
He wants to destroy me inch by inch. 

670
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,520
It is a game, Lestrade, and not one I'm willing to play. 

671
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,880
Give my regards to Sergeant Donovan. 

672

COMPUTER BLEEPS 

673
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:45,480
- They'll be deciding. 
- Deciding? 

674
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,960
- Whether to come back with a warrant and arrest me. 
- You think? 

675
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,600
- Standard procedure. 
- You should have gone with him. People'll think... 

676
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,560
I don't care what people think. 

677
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:57,600
You'd care if they thought you were stupid or wrong. 

678
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,000
No, that would just make them stupid or wrong. 

679
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,720
Sherlock, I don't want the world believing you're... 

680
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,280
That I am what? 

681
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:10,880
A fraud. 

682
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:17,320
- You're worried they're right. 
- What? 
- That they're right about me. 
- No. 
- That's why you're upset. 

683
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,080
You can't entertain the possibility they may be right. 

684
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:22,440
- You're afraid you've been taken in. 
- I'm not. 

685
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:26,120
Moriarty is playing with your mind, too. Can't you SEE what's going on?! 

686
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,400
- No, I know you for real. 
- 100 percent? 

687
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,880
Well, nobody could fake being such an annoying dick all the time. 

688
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,920
- Sherlock Holmes? 
- Yes, sir. 

689
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:46,160
That bloke that's been in the press? 

690
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,480
Mm-hm. 

691
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:50,800
I thought he was some sort of private eye. 

692
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,280
- He is. 
- We've been consulting with him, that's what you're telling me? 

693
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,400
Not used him on any proper cases though, have we? 

694
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:58,640
Well, one or two. 

695
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:00,280
Or 20 or 30. 

696
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:01,720
What?! 

697
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:05,040
- I'm not the only senior officer who did this. Gregson... 
- Shut up! 

698
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:09,840
An amateur detective given access to all sorts of classified information. 

699
00:52:09,840 --> 00:52:12,960
And now he's a suspect in a case. 

700
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:15,840
- With all due respect... 
- You're a bloody idiot, Lestrade! 

701
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,560
Now go and fetch him in, right now. 

702
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:19,120
Do it! 

703
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:28,080
- Proud of yourselves? 
- Well, what if it's not just this case? 

704
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,960
What if he's done this to us every single time?

PHONE BLEEPS 

706
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:46,120
So, still got some friends on the force. It's Lestrade. 

707
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:48,080
Says they're all coming over here now. 

708
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,920
Queuing up to slap on the handcuffs. 

709
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:52,360
Every officer you've ever made feel like a tit, 

710
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:53,640
which is a lot of people. 

711
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,480
Yoo-hoo. 

712
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,400
Oh, sorry, am I interrupting? 

713
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:01,360
Some chap delivered a parcel, I forgot, marked perishable. 

714
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:03,800
I had to sign for it. 

715
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:07,600
Funny name, German, like the fairy tales. 

716
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,600
SIRENS BLARE 

717
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,000
Burnt to a crisp.

00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:21,960
What does it mean? DOORBELL RINGS 

719
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,800
- KNOCKING AT DOOR 
- 'Police!' 
- I'll go. 

720
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,360
'Sherlock. 

721
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,840
- 'Excuse me, Mrs Hudson. 
- We need to talk to you. 

722
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:30,200
'You can't just barge in like that!' 

723
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,480
JOHN: 'Have you got a warrant? Have you?' 

724
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:34,960
- LESTRADE: 
- 'Leave it, John. 

725
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,040
'Eh? Manners!' 

726
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:41,880
Sherlock Holmes, I'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and kidnapping. 

727
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,640
- It's OK, John. 
- He's not resisting. 

728
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,880
No, it's not all right, this is ridiculous. 

729
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,200
Get him downstairs now. 

730
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:48,480
You don't have to do this. 

731
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,000
Don't try to interfere or I shall arrest you too. 

732
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,320
You done? 

733
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,400
- I said it. 
- Hmm? 

734
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,440
- First time we met. 
- Don't bother. 

735
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:03,280
Solving crimes won't be enough. One day he'll cross the line. 

736
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:07,440
Now ask yourself, what sort of man would kidnap those kids 

737
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,680
just so he can impress us all by finding them? 

738
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:14,160
- Donovan? 
- Sir? 
- Got our man? 
- Er, yes, sir. 

739
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,440
Looked a bit of a weirdo, if you ask me. 

740
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,920
Often are, these vigilante types. 

741
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,200
What are you looking at? 

742
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,960
Are you all right, sir? 

743
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:30,880
- Joining me? 
- Yeah. 

744
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:35,120
Well, apparently it's against the law to chin the Chief Superintendent. 

745
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,080
Hmm. Bit awkward this. 

746
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,400
There's no-one to bail us. 

747
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,800
I was thinking more about our imminent and daring escape. 

748
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,200
- 'All units to 27.' 
- What? 

749
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,760
'All units to 2...' 

750
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:51,240
- ALARM SOUNDS 
- Aah! 

751
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:54,400
Ladies and gentlemen, will you all please get on your knees? 

752
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:58,920
- GUNFIRE 
- NOW would be good! 
- Do as he says! 

753
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,600
Just so you're aware, the gun is his idea, I'm just a...you know. 

754
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:08,840
- My hostage. 
- Hostage, yes, that works. That works. 

755
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,280
So what now? 

756
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,320
Doing what Moriarty wants, becoming a fugitive. Run! 

757
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,320
Get after him, Lestrade! 

758
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,120
Take my hand. 

759
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,480
SIRENS BLARE 

760
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:28,520
- Now people will definitely talk. The gun! 
- Leave it! 

761
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:37,160
Sherlock, wait! 

762
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,480
We're going to need to coordinate. 

763
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,200
- Go to your right. 
- Huh? 
- Go to your right. 

764
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,280
SIREN BLARES 

765
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,480
Everybody wants to believe it, that's what makes it so clever. 

766
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,360
A lie that's preferable to the truth. 

767
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:58,480
My deductions were a sham. No-one feels inadequate, Sherlock's an ordinary man. 

768
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,640
Mycroft, he could help us. 

769
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:04,440
Big family reconciliation, now's not really the moment. 

770
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,360
Sherlock...we're being followed. I knew we couldn't outrun the police. 

771
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:13,880
That's not the police, it's one of my new neighbours from Baker Street. 

772
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:16,240
Let's see if he can give us some answers. 

773
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,840
(Where are we going?) 

774
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,080
We're going to jump in front of that bus. 

775
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:32,800
- BOTH: 
- Oof! 

776
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,680
BUS BLASTS HORN 

777
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,840
Oh... 

778
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,480
Tell me what you want from me. 

779
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:41,400
Tell me! 

780
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:42,800
He left it at your flat. 

781
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,080
- Who? 
- Moriarty. 

782
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,560
What? 

783
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,760
- The computer key code. 
- Of course. 

784
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:52,320
He's selling it. The programme he used to break into the Tower. 

785
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,920
He planted it when he came around. 

786
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,920
GUNFIRE 

787
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,480
SIREN BLARES 

788
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:11,880
THEY PANT 

789
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:14,400
It's a game-changer. 

790
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,840
It's a key, it can break into any system 

791
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,600
and it's sitting in our flat right now. 

792
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,680
That's why he left that message, telling everyone where to come, "Get Sherlock!" 

793
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,160
- We need to get back into the flat and search. 
- CID will be camped out. 

794
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:28,600
Why plant it on you? 

795
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,880
It's another subtle way of smearing my name, 

796
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,160
now I'm best pals with all those criminals. 

797
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:37,240
Yeah, well, have you seen this? 

798
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,160
A kiss-and-tell. 

799
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,120
Some bloke called Rich Brook. 

800
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,600
Who is he?

00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:55,200
ALARM BLEEPS 

802
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,320
Too late to go on the record? 

803
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,760
Congratulations, "The Truth About Sherlock Holmes." 

804
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:19,920
The scoop that everybody wanted and you got it. Bravo! 

805
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,880
I gave you your opportunity. 

806
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:24,080
I wanted to be on your side, remember? 

807
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:25,360
You turned me down, so... 

808
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,240
Then lo and behold, someone spills all the beans. 

809
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:31,480
How utterly convenient. Who is Brook? 

810
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:34,800
Oh, come on, Kitty, no-one trusts the voice at the end of a phone. 

811
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,880
All those little meetings in cafes, 

812
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,440
those sessions in the hotel room when he gabbled into your Dictaphone. 

813
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:42,680
How do you know that you can trust him? 

814
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:45,960
A man turns up with the Holy Grail in his pockets. 

815
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,440
What were his credentials? 

816
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:53,760
Darling, they didn't have any ground coffee, so I just got normal. 

817
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,560
You said that they wouldn't find me here, you said that I'd be safe here. 

818
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,600
You are safe. 

819
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:09,040
Richard, I'm a witness, they wouldn't harm you in front of witnesses. 

820
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,440
So that's your source? Moriarty is Richard Brook? 

821
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:15,200
Of course he's Richard Brook, there is no Moriarty. 

822
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:19,040
- There never has been. 
- What are you talking about? 
- Look him up. 

823
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:23,760
Rich Brook, an actor Sherlock Holmes hired to be Moriarty. 

824
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:31,440
Dr Watson, I know you're a good man, 

825
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:34,800
don't, don't, don't hurt me. 

826
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,800
No, you are Moriarty! He's Moriarty! 

827
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,800
We've met, remember? You were going to blow me up! 

828
00:59:40,800 --> 00:59:43,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

829
00:59:43,280 --> 00:59:46,920
He paid me, I needed the work. I'm an actor, I was out of work. 

830
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,160
Sherlock, you'd better explain, because I am not getting this. 

831
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,880
I'll be doing the explaining, in print. 

832
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,640
It's all here, conclusive proof. 

833
00:59:57,240 --> 00:59:59,640
You invented James Moriarty, your nemesis. 

834
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,480
- Invented him?! 
- Mm-hm. 

835
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,920
He invented all the crimes, actually. 

836
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:06,440
And to cap it all, he made up a master villain. 

837
01:00:06,440 --> 01:00:10,080
- Don't be ridiculous! 
- Ask him. He's right here. Just ask him. 

838
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:13,360
- Tell him, Richard. 
- For God's sake, this man was on trial! 

839
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:17,200
Yes, and you paid him to take the rap. Promised you'd rig the jury. 

840
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,640
Not exactly a West End role, but I'll bet the money was good. 

841
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:23,520
But not so good he didn't want to sell his story. 

842
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,080
I am sorry. I am. I am sorry. 

843
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:28,720
So this is the story you're going to publish? 

844
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,920
- The big conclusion of it all, Moriarty's an actor? 
- He knows I am. 

845
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,920
I have proof. Show them... Kitty, show them something. 

846
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:37,920
Yeah, show me something. 

847
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,280
I'm on TV. I'm on kids' TV. I'm the story-teller. 

848
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:52,640
I'm the story-teller. It's on DVD. 

849
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:03,080
Just tell him. It's all coming out. It's all over. 

850
01:01:03,080 --> 01:01:06,560
Just tell them. Just tell them. Tell them! It's all over now! 

851
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:09,600
No! Don't you touch me! Don't you lay a finger on me! 

852
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,640
Stop it now! 

853
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,200
- Don't hurt me! 
- Don't let him get away! 

854
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:16,520
Leave him alone! 

855
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,520
No, no, no. He'll have back-up. 

856
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:23,480
Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes? 

857
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:29,000
I look at you know and I can read you...and you repel me. 

858
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:35,480
Can he do that? 

859
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:38,360
Completely change his identity, make you the criminal? 

860
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:40,280
He's got my whole life story. 

861
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,360
That's what you do when you sell a big lie, 

862
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:45,000
you wrap it up in the truth to make it more palatable. 

863
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,840
It'll be your word against his. 

864
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:50,040
He's been sowing doubt into people's minds for 24 hours. 

865
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:54,040
There's only one thing he needs to do to complete his game and that... 

866
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:56,480
Sherlock? 

867
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:01,600
- There's something I need to do. 
- What? Can I help? 
- No, on my own. 

868
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,280
You're wrong, you know? 

869
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:23,480
You do count. 

870
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,000
You've always counted and I've always trusted you. 

871
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:31,320
But you were right. 

872
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:35,120
I'm not OK. 

873
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,400
Tell me what's wrong. 

874
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:42,680
Molly, I think I'm going to die. 

875
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,120
- What do you need? 
- If I wasn't everything that you think I am, 

876
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,320
everything that I think I am... 

877
01:02:51,320 --> 01:02:53,640
..would you still want to help me? 

878
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:57,440
What do you need? 

879
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:06,360
You. 

880
01:03:19,520 --> 01:03:24,040
She has really done her homework, Miss Riley, 

881
01:03:24,040 --> 01:03:28,040
and it's things that only someone close to Sherlock could know. 

882
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,520
- Ah. 
- Have you seen your brother's address book lately? 

883
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:36,040
Two names - yours and mine... 

884
01:03:36,040 --> 01:03:39,040
and Moriarty didn't get this stuff from me. 

885
01:03:39,040 --> 01:03:42,560
- John... 
- So how does it work, your relationship? 

886
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:46,240
Do you go out for a coffee now and then, you and Jim? 

887
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,440
Your own brother 

888
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:54,320
and you blabbed about his entire life to this maniac. 

889
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,040
I never intend...I never dreamt... 

890
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:03,120
This...this is what you were trying to tell me, isn't it? 

891
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,040
"Watch his back because I've made a mistake." 

892
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:11,600
How did you meet him? 

893
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:19,360
People like him, we know about them, we watch them. 

894
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,040
But James Moriarty... 

895
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:29,320
..the most dangerous criminal mind the world has ever seen, 

896
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,440
and, in his pocket, the ultimate weapon. 

897
01:04:32,440 --> 01:04:34,560
The key code. 

898
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:38,520
A few lines of computer code that can unlock any door. 

899
01:04:39,520 --> 01:04:44,040
And you abducted him to try and find the key code? 

900
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,560
Interrogated him for weeks. 

901
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,600
- And? 
- He wouldn't play along. 

902
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:54,280
He just sat there 

903
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,040
staring into the darkness. 

904
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:03,040
The only thing that made him open up... 

905
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,040
I could get him to talk, just a little. 

906
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,280
But... 

907
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:17,840
In return you had to offer him Sherlock's life story. 

908
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:21,320
So, one big lie... 

909
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,360
..Sherlock's a fraud, 

910
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:28,160
and people will swallow it because the rest of it's true. 

911
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,680
Moriarty wanted Sherlock destroyed, right, 

912
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:38,040
and you have given him the perfect ammunition. 

913
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,040
John. 

914
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,760
I'm sorry. 

915
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,680
Oh, please! 

916
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:56,520
Tell him, would you? 

917
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,760
I got your message. 

918
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,360
The computer code is the key to this. We find it, we can use it. 

919
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:16,280
- Use it? 
- He used it to create a false identity 

920
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:19,120
so we can break into the records and destroy Richard Brook. 

921
01:06:19,120 --> 01:06:20,800
Bring back Jim Moriarty again. 

922
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:21,880
Somewhere in 221b, 

923
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,680
somewhere on the day of the verdict he left it hidden. 

924
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:26,040
Uh-huh. 

925
01:06:27,280 --> 01:06:29,920
- What did he touch? 
- An apple, nothing else. 

926
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:32,640
- Did he write anything down? 
- No. 

927
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,040
MOBILE RINGS 

928
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:22,040
Oh. 

929
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:26,680
Yeah, speaking. 

930
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:27,960
What? 

931
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,880
What happened? Is she OK? 

932
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,440
Oh, my God! Right, yes, I'm coming. 

933
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,640
- What is it? 
- Paramedics. Mrs Hudson's been shot. 

934
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,920
- How? 
- Probably one of the killers you managed to attract. Jesus! 

935
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:42,760
- She's dying, Sherlock. Let's go. 
- You go. I'm busy. 

936
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:45,320
- Busy?! 
- Thinking. I need to think. 

937
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,960
You need to...? Doesn't she mean anything to you? 

938
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,880
You once half-killed a man because he laid a finger on her. 

939
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:54,720
- She's my landlady. 
- She's dying...you machine! 

940
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,040
Sod this. Sod this! You stay here if you want, on your own. 

941
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,560
Alone is what I have. Alone protects me. 

942
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:02,640
No, friends protect people. 

943
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,360
TEXT ALERT 

944
01:08:22,040 --> 01:08:24,800
# I've been kicked around since I was born 

945
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,240
# But now it's all right, it's OK 

946
01:08:27,240 --> 01:08:29,280
# You can look the other way 

947
01:08:29,280 --> 01:08:31,480
# We can try to understand 

948
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:34,000
# The New York Times' effect on man 

949
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,920
# Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother 

950
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,040
# You're stayin' alive... # 

951
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:43,040
Well...here we are at last. 

952
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:46,160
You and me, Sherlock. 

953
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:49,680
And our problem - the final problem. 

954
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,760
Staying alive! 

955
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,120
It's so boring, isn't it? 

956
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:01,520
It's just staying. 

957
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,520
All my life I've been searching for distractions 

958
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,600
and you were the best distraction and now I don't even have you 

959
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:10,960
because I've beaten you. 

960
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:14,040
And you know what? In the end, it was easy. 

961
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:17,120
It was easy. 

962
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:20,400
Now I've got to go back to playing with the ordinary people, 

963
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,520
and it turns out you're ordinary, just like all of them. 

964
01:09:24,520 --> 01:09:27,440
Ah, well. 

965
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:32,680
Did you almost start to wonder if I was real? 

966
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:35,360
Did I nearly get you? 

967
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,720
Richard Brook. 

968
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:41,800
Nobody seems to get the joke, but you do. 

969
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:43,880
- Of course. 
- Attaboy. 

970
01:09:43,880 --> 01:09:46,600
Richard Brook in German is Reichenbach. 

971
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:50,680
- The case that made my name. 
- Just trying to have some fun. 

972
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:58,120
Good. You got that too. 

973
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,040
Beats like digits. 

974
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:06,040
Every beat is a one, every rest is a zero. 

975
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:07,720
Binary code. 

976
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:10,560
That's why all those assassins tried to save my life. 

977
01:10:10,560 --> 01:10:13,240
It was hidden on me, hidden inside my head. 

978
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:16,680
A few simple lines of computer code that can break into any system. 

979
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:21,160
Told all my clients, last one to Sherlock is a sissy. 

980
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:26,040
But now that it's up here, I can use it to alter all the records. 

981
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:31,000
I can kill Rich Brook and bring back Jim Moriarty. 

982
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,320
No, no, no, no, no. This is too easy. 

983
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,240
This is too easy. 

984
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,720
There is no key, doofus! 

985
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:48,160
Those digits are meaningless. They're utterly meaningless. 

986
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:51,760
You don't really think a couple of lines of computer code 

987
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,440
are going to crash the world around our ears? 

988
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,120
I'm disappointed in you, ordinary Sherlock. 

989
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:02,680
- But the rhythm... 
- Partita no 1! Thank you, Johann Sebastian Bach. 

990
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:06,800
- But then how did you...? 
- How did I break into the bank, to the Tower, to the prison? 

991
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:11,040
Daylight robbery! All it takes is some willing participants. 

992
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,840
I knew you'd fall for it. That's your weakness. 

993
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:22,280
You always want everything to be clever. 

994
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,960
Shall we finish the game? One final act. 

995
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,400
Glad you chose a tall building. Nice way to do it. 

996
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,440
Do it? Do what? 

997
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,040
Yes, of course. 

998
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,560
My suicide. 

999
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:41,120
Genius detective proved to be a fraud. 

1000
01:11:41,120 --> 01:11:43,880
I read it in the paper so it must be true. 

1001
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,320
I love newspapers. 

1002
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,400
Fairy tales. 

1003
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:54,040
And pretty grim ones too. 

1004
01:12:02,160 --> 01:12:06,200
Oh, God, John, you made me jump. Is everything OK with the police? 

1005
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:08,840
Has Sherlock sorted it all out? 

1006
01:12:10,840 --> 01:12:13,360
Oh, my God. 

1007
01:12:16,520 --> 01:12:17,720
Taxi! 

1008
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,320
Taxi! No, no, no. Police...sort of! 

1009
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:24,320
Thanks, mate. Thanks a lot! 

1010
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:27,360
I can prove that you created an entirely false identity. 

1011
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:30,520
Oh, just kill yourself. It's a lot less effort. 

1012
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:33,880
Go on. 

1013
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,320
For me. 

1014
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:38,040
Please! 

1015
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:43,720
You're insane. 

1016
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,360
You're just getting that now? Wo-wo-wo! 

1017
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,040
OK. 

1018
01:12:50,680 --> 01:12:53,880
Let me give you a little extra incentive. 

1019
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,040
Your friends will die if you don't. 

1020
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,320
John? 

1021
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,520
Not just John. Everyone. 

1022
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:04,440
- Mrs Hudson? 
- Everyone. 

1023
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:10,320
- Lestrade? 
- Three bullets, three gunmen, three victims. 

1024
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,760
There's no stopping them now... 

1025
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:17,280
..unless my people see you jump. 

1026
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:28,440
You can have me arrested, you can torture me, 

1027
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,040
you can do anything you like with me, 

1028
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:34,640
but nothing's going to prevent them from pulling the trigger. 

1029
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,920
Your only three friends in the world will die unless... 

1030
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,040
Unless I kill myself and complete your story. 

1031
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:44,840
You've got to admit, that's sexier. 

1032
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:49,520
- And I die in disgrace. 
- Of course. That's the point of this. 

1033
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:52,600
Oh. You've got an audience now. 

1034
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:56,040
Off you pop. 

1035
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,440
Go on. 

1036
01:14:00,520 --> 01:14:02,600
I told you how this ends. 

1037
01:14:06,080 --> 01:14:09,760
Your death is the only thing that's going to call off the killers. 

1038
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:12,040
I'm certainly not going to do it. 

1039
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:16,800
Would you give me one moment, please? 

1040
01:14:17,800 --> 01:14:19,920
One moment of privacy. 

1041
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,440
Please. 

1042
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:26,320
Of course. 

1043
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,720
HE LAUGHS 

1044
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,760
What?! 

1045
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:53,960
What is it? 

1046
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:58,040
What did I miss? 

1047
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,440
You're not going to do it. 

1048
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,440
So the killers can be called off, 

1049
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:08,440
then there's a recall code or a word or a number. 

1050
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,400
I don't have to die 

1051
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:15,360
if I've got you. 

1052
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:17,000
Oh! 

1053
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,680
You think you can make me stop the order? 

1054
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:24,040
- You think you can make me do that? 
- Yes. 

1055
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,960
- So do you. 
- Sherlock, your big brother and all the King's horses 

1056
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,480
couldn't make me do a thing I didn't want to. 

1057
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,840
Yes, but I'm not my brother, remember? 

1058
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,040
I am you. 

1059
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,240
Prepared to do anything. 

1060
01:15:38,240 --> 01:15:40,440
Prepared to burn. 

1061
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:44,120
Prepared to do what ordinary people won't do. 

1062
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:48,960
You want me to shake hands with you in hell? I shall not disappoint you. 

1063
01:15:49,960 --> 01:15:51,640
Nah. 

1064
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:55,200
You talk big. 

1065
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,200
Nah. 

1066
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:59,280
You're ordinary. 

1067
01:15:59,280 --> 01:16:02,240
You're ordinary. You're on the side of the angels. 

1068
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:05,320
Oh, I may be on the side of the angels, 

1069
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:11,040
but don't think for one second that I am one of them. 

1070
01:16:19,280 --> 01:16:20,800
No... 

1071
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,520
..you're not. 

1072
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,000
I see. 

1073
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:35,800
You're not ordinary. 

1074
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,320
No. 

1075
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:40,600
You're me. 

1076
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,240
You're me. 

1077
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:48,200
Thank you... 

1078
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:51,240
..Sherlock Holmes. 

1079
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,200
Thank you. 

1080
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,040
Bless you. 

1081
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:13,040
As long as I'm alive, you can save your friends, you've got a way out. 

1082
01:17:14,040 --> 01:17:16,160
Well, good luck with that. 

1083
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:30,040
No. 

1084
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,880
Yes, sir. Thank you. Bye. 

1085
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:35,040
MOBILE DIAL TONE 

1086
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,320
MOBILE RINGS Hello? 

1087
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,760
- John. 
- Hey, Sherlock. Are you OK? 

1088
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:46,080
- Turn around and walk back the way you came. 
- I'm coming in. 

1089
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:48,240
Just do as I ask! 

1090
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:49,640
Please. 

1091
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,360
Where? 

1092
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:54,560
Stop there. 

1093
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,720
- Sherlock? 
- OK, look up. I'm on the rooftop. 

1094
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:01,320
Oh, God. 

1095
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,800
I...I can't come down, so we'll just have to do it like this. 

1096
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:08,000
What's going on? 

1097
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:09,960
An apology. 

1098
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:14,040
It's all true. 

1099
01:19:14,040 --> 01:19:16,040
What? 

1100
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:21,280
Everything they said about me. I invented Moriarty. 

1101
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:29,360
Why are you saying this? 

1102
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:34,320
I'm a fake. 

1103
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,000
- Sherlock... 
- The newspapers were right all along. 

1104
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:41,040
I want you to tell Lestrade, 

1105
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:44,800
I want you to tell Mrs Hudson and Molly. 

1106
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,760
In fact, tell anyone who will listen to you... 

1107
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,520
..that I created Moriarty for my own purposes. 

1108
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,120
OK, shut up Sherlock. Shut up. 

1109
01:19:56,120 --> 01:19:59,000
The first time we met... the first time we met, 

1110
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:02,520
- you knew all about my sister, right? 
- Nobody could be that clever. 

1111
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:05,400
You could. 

1112
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:14,440
I researched you. 

1113
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:18,640
Before we met, I discovered everything that I could 

1114
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,920
to impress you. 

1115
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,640
It's a trick. Just a magic trick. 

1116
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,960
No. All right, stop it now. 

1117
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:29,520
No. Stay exactly where you are. 

1118
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:32,440
- Don't move. 
- All right. 

1119
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,120
Keep your eyes fixed on me. 

1120
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,480
- Please, will you do this for me? 
- Do what? 

1121
01:20:40,480 --> 01:20:42,160
This phone call, it's... 

1122
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,040
..it's my note. 

1123
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:49,840
It's what people do, don't they? 

1124
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,680
Leave a note? 

1125
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:57,440
Leave a note when? 

1126
01:20:57,440 --> 01:21:00,400
- Goodbye, John. 
- No. Don't... 

1127
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:12,960
Sherlock! 

1128
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:17,840
Sherlock. 

1129
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:07,320
Sherlock...Sherlock. 

1130
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:12,160
I'm a doctor, let me come through. Let me come through, please. 

1131
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:14,600
He's my friend. He's my friend... Please. 

1132
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:32,920
Please, let me just... 

1133
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:41,440
Oh, Jesus! 

1134
01:22:41,440 --> 01:22:43,120
No. 

1135
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,800
God, no. 

1136
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,440
There's stuff that you wanted to say... 

1137
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,040
- ..but didn't say it. 
- Yeah. 

1138
01:24:35,640 --> 01:24:37,720
Say it now. 

1139
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:45,320
Sorry, I can't. 

1140
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:58,040
There's all the stuff. All the science equipment. 

1141
01:24:58,040 --> 01:25:01,520
I left it all in boxes. I don't know what needs doing. 

1142
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:04,040
I thought I'd take it to a school. 

1143
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:10,040
- Would you...? 
- I can't go back to the flat again, not at the moment. 

1144
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:14,520
I'm angry. 

1145
01:25:14,520 --> 01:25:17,440
It's OK, John. There's nothing unusual in that. 

1146
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:20,000
That's the way he made everyone feel. 

1147
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:23,680
All the marks on my table and the noise, 

1148
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:27,000
- firing guns at half past one in the morning... 
- Yeah. 

1149
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:29,400
..bloody specimens in my fridge. 

1150
01:25:29,400 --> 01:25:32,520
- Imagine, keeping bodies where there's food. 
- Yes. 

1151
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:36,560
And the fighting! Drove me up the wall with all his carryings-on. 

1152
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,240
Listen, I'm not actually that angry, OK? 

1153
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:43,280
OK. I'll leave you alone to, you know... 

1154
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:55,680
Erm... 

1155
01:25:56,680 --> 01:25:58,040
Hmm. 

1156
01:25:58,040 --> 01:26:01,040
You...you told me once... 

1157
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,400
..that you weren't a hero. 

1158
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:08,200
Erm, there were times I didn't even think you were human, 

1159
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,320
but let me tell you this, you were... 

1160
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:13,000
the best man... 

1161
01:26:13,000 --> 01:26:18,000
the most human...human being that I've ever known 

1162
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:22,040
and no-one will ever convince me that you told me a lie, so... 

1163
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:25,240
..there. 

1164
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:34,280
I was so alone... 

1165
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:38,040
..and I owe you so much. 

1166
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:46,080
But, please, there's just one more thing, one more thing, 

1167
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,480
