RUNNING AND PANTING

00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,080
A MAN YELLS

00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,720
YELLING AND GROWLING

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,960
GROWLING

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,280
THE MAN CRIES IN PAIN

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,720
Oh, hello.

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,360
Are you all right?

8
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,480
What is it, dear? Are you lost?

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,920
GROWLING

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,160
HE SCREAMS

13
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:52,240
Well, that was tedious.
You went on the tube like that?

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,200
None of the cabs would take me.

15
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,320
Nothing?

16
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,680
Military coup in Uganda. Hm.

17
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,160
Hm.

18
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,240
Another photo of you
with the er... Oh!

19
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,200
Well, um, Cabinet reshuffle?

20
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,840
Nothing of importance?

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,360
BANGS ON THE FLOOR
Oh, God!

22
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,200
John, I need some. Get me some.

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,040
No. Get me some.

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,680
No. Cold turkey we agreed,
no matter what.

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,120
Anyway, you've paid
everyone off, remember?

26
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,720
No-one within a two-mile radius
will sell you any.

27
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,320
Stupid idea. Whose idea was that?

28
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,440
HE CLEARS THROAT

29
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,160
Mrs Hudson!

30
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,560
Look, Sherlock, you're doing
really well, don't give up now!

31
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,600
Tell me where they are!

32
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,000
Please, tell me.

33
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,080
Please.

34
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,600
Can't help, sorry. I'll let you know
next week's lottery numbers.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,880
HE LAUGHS
It was worth a try.

36
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,480
Yoo-hoo.

37
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,520
My secret supply, what have you done
with my secret supply?

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,760
Eh? Cigarettes, what have you done
with them?

39
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,680
You never let me touch your things!
Oh, chance would be a fine thing.

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,680
I thought you weren't
my housekeeper. I'm not. Argh!

41
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,120
How about a nice cuppa and perhaps
you could put away your harpoon?

42
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,360
I need something stronger than tea.
Seven percent stronger.

43
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,280
You've been to see Mr Chatterjee
again. Pardon?

44
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,080
Sandwich shop. That's a new dress,
but there's flour on the sleeve. You
wouldn't dress like that for baking.

45
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,800
Sherlock...
Thumbnail. Tiny traces of foil.

46
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,920
Been at the scratch cards again.
We all know where that leads.

47
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,880
Kasbah Nights. Racy for a
Monday morning, wouldn't you agree?

48
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:53,360
I wrote a blog on the identification
of perfumes. You should look it up!

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,640
Please! Don't pin your hopes on that
cruise with Mr Chatterjee, he's got
a wife nobody knows about. Sherlock!

50
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,840
Well, nobody except me.
I don't know what you're
talking about, I really don't!

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,120
DOOR SLAMS BEHIND HER

52
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,640
What the bloody hell was all
that about? You don't understand.

53
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,960
Go after her and apologise.

54
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,800
Apologise? Hmm.

55
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,280
Oh, John, I envy you so much.

56
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,240
You envy me?

57
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,320
Your mind, it's so placid,
straight-forward, barely used.

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,040
Mine's like an engine,
racing out of control.

59
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,480
A rocket, tearing itself to pieces,
trapped on the launch pad.
I need a case!

60
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,880
You've just solved one, by harpooning
a dead pig, apparently!

61
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,600
Oh, that was this morning.

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,080
When's the next one?
Nothing on the website?

63
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,160
"Dear Mr Sherlock Holmes.
I can't find Bluebell anywhere.

64
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,400
"Please, please,
please can you help?"

65
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,360
Bluebell? A rabbit, John! Oh.
Ah, but there's more.

66
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,040
Before Bluebell disappeared,
it turned luminous.

67
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,160
"Like a fairy," according to little
Kirsty. Then the next morning,
Bluebell was gone.

68
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,360
Hutch still locked,
no sign of a forced entry.

69
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:03,360
What am I saying, this is brilliant!
Phone Lestrade.

70
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,280
Tell him there's an escaped rabbit.
Are you serious? It's this or Cluedo.

71
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,800
Ah, no.
We are never playing that again.

72
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,400
Why not? It's not possible
for the victim to have done it.

73
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:16,160
It was the only possible solution.
It's not in the rules.

74
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, then, the rules are wrong!

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,440
DOORBELL RINGS

76
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,880
A single ring.

77
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,640
Maximum pressure,
just under the half second.

78
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,000
BOTH: Client!

79
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,440
TV: Dartmoor, it's always been
a place of myth and legend,

80
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,680
but is there something else
lurking out here?

81
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,000
Something very real.

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,920
Dartmoor is also home
to one the government's
most secret of operations,

83
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,880
the chemical and biological weapons
research centre,

84
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,480
which is said to be even more
sensitive than Porton Down.

85
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,000
Since the end of
the Second World War,

86
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,640
there have been persistent stories
about the Baskerville experiments.

87
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,240
Genetic mutations,
animals grown for the battlefield.

88
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,680
There are many who believe
that within this compound, in
the heart of this ancient wildness,

89
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,960
there are horrors beyond imagining.

90
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,040
But the real question is,
are all of them still inside?'

91
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,640
I was just a kid.

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,400
It was on the moor.

93
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,520
It was dark, but I know what I saw.

94
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,760
I know what killed my father.

95
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,720
What did you see?

96
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,360
Oh, I was just about to say.

97
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,120
Yes, in a TV interview.
I prefer to do my own editing.

98
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,800
Yes. Sorry, yes, of course.

99
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,240
Excuse me.
BLOWS HIS NOSE

100
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,360
In your own time.

101
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
But quite quickly.

102
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,360
Do you know Dartmoor, Mr Holmes? No.

103
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,720
It's an amazing place,
it's like nowhere else,

104
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,280
it's sort of bleak, but beautiful.

105
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,440
Hm, not interested. Moving on.

106
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,840
We used to go for walks,
after my mum died, my dad and me.

107
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,360
Every evening,
we'd go out onto the moor.

108
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:08,320
Good. Skipping to the night
that your dad was violently killed,
where did that happen?

109
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,960
There's a place,

110
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,440
it's a sort of local landmark,
called Dewer's Hollow.

111
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,320
That's an ancient name
for the devil.

112
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,920
So?

113
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,200
Did you see the devil that night?

114
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,160
Yes.

115
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,080
HE CRIES OUT

116
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,720
It was huge.

117
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,280
Coal-black fur with red eyes.

118
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,280
IT GROWLS

119
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,120
It got him.

120
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,760
Tore at him, tore him apart.

121
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,080
I can't remember anything else.

122
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,960
They found me the next morning,
just wandering on the moor.

123
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
My dad's body was never found.

124
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,520
Hm.

125
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:09,240
Red eyes, coal-black fur,
enormous...

126
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,680
A dog? Wolf?

127
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,160
Or a genetic experiment.

128
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,960
Are you laughing at me, Mr Holmes?

129
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,160
Why, are you joking?

130
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,280
My dad was always going on about
the things they were doing
at Baskerville.

131
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,240
About the type of monsters
they were breeding there.

132
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,600
People used to laugh at him.

133
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,040
At least the TV people
took me seriously.

134
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,120
And I assume did wonders
for Devon tourism. Yeah...

135
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:41,480
Henry, whatever did happen
to your father, it was 20 years ago.

136
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,400
Why come to us now?

137
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,440
Not sure you can help me, Mr Holmes,
since you find it all so funny!

138
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:53,120
Because of what happened last night.
Why, what happened last night?

139
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,640
How... How do you know?

140
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,240
I didn't know, I noticed.

141
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,960
You came up from Devon
on the first train this morning.

142
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,760
You had a disappointing breakfast
and a black coffee. The girl
across the aisle fancied you.

143
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,200
Though initially keen,
you've changed your mind.

144
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,000
You are anxious to have
your first cigarette of the day.

145
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,960
Sit down, Mr Knight, and do
please smoke. I'd be delighted.

146
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,560
How on Earth did you notice
all that? It's not important...

147
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,960
Punched out holes where your
ticket's been checked. Not now.

148
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:35,800
I've been cooped-up for ages!
You're showing off. I am a show-off,
that's what we do.

149
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,200
Train napkin you used to mop up
the spilled coffee.

150
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,920
Strength of the stain shows
that you didn't take milk.

151
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,760
There are traces of ketchup on it
and on your lips and sleeve.

152
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,360
Cooked breakfast, or the nearest
thing those trains manage. Sandwich.

153
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,600
How did you know
it was disappointing?

154
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,840
Is there any other type of breakfast
on a train? The girl.

155
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:57,120
Female handwriting's distinctive,
wrote her number on the napkin.

156
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,720
I can tell from the angle she wrote
at that she was sat across from you.

157
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,360
After she got off, I imagine
you used the napkin to mop up
your spilled coffee,

158
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,280
accidentally smudging the numbers.

159
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,320
You've been over the last
four digits in another pen,
so you wanted to keep the number.

160
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,200
You used the napkin to blow your
nose, so you're not that into her.

161
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,840
Then there's the nicotine stains
on your shaking fingers.
I know the signs.

162
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,880
No chance to smoke when
on the train, no time to roll one
before you got a cab here.

163
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,600
It's just after 9.15,
you're desperate.

164
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,360
The first train from Exeter
to London leaves at 5.46am.

165
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,400
You got the first one, so something
important must have happened
last night. Am I wrong?

166
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,000
No.

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,880
You're right.

168
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,280
You're completely, exactly right.

169
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,640
Bloody hell, I heard you were quick.
It's my job. Now shut up and smoke.

170
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,080
Ahem.

171
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:56,880
Henry, your parents both died
and you were what, seven years old?

172
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,520
I know, that...

173
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
HE INHALES THE SMOKE

174
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,160
That must be quite a trauma.

175
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,840
Now, have you ever thought that maybe
you invented this story, this...

176
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,560
HE INHALES LOUDLY

177
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,040
..to account for it?

178
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,520
That's what Dr Mortimer says.

179
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,600
Who? His therapist. My therapist.

180
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,800
Obviously.

181
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,200
Louise Mortimer.

182
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,760
She's the reason
I came back to Dartmoor.

183
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,000
She thinks I have to face my demons.

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,400
What happened when you went back
to Dewer's Hollow last night?

185
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,680
You went there on the advice of your
therapist and now you're consulting
a detective.

186
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:40,480
What did you see that changed
everything? It's a strange place,
the Hollow.

187
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,000
It makes you feel
so cold inside, so afraid.

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,840
Yes, if I wanted poetry, I'd read
John's emails to his girlfriends,
much funnier. What did you see?

189
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,960
HE SIGHS

190
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,360
Footprints.

191
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
On the exact spot
where I saw my father torn apart.

192
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,040
Man's or a woman's?

193
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,840
Neither. They were...
Is that it? Nothing else?
Footprints, is that all?

194
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,120
Yes. But they were...

195
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,840
Dr Mortimer wins.
It's a childhood trauma
masked by an invented memory.

196
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:14,760
Boring. Goodbye, Mr Knight,
thank you for smoking.
What about the footprints?

197
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,080
Oh, they're probably paw prints,
could be anything,
therefore nothing.

198
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,280
Off to Devon with you
and have a cream tea on me.

199
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:24,000
Mr Holmes, they were
the footprints of a gigantic hound.

200
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,720
Say that again.

201
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,560
I found footprints, they were big...

202
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,160
No, no, no, your exact words.

203
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:39,400
Repeat your exact words
from a moment ago,
exactly as you said them.

204
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,880
Mr Holmes,

205
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:49,200
they were
the footprints of a gigantic hound.

206
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,640
I'll take the case. Sorry, what?

207
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:59,400
Thank you for bringing this to
my attention, it's very promising.
Sorry, what?

208
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,760
A minute ago, footprints were boring,
now they're very promising?

209
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,720
It's got nothing to do with
footprints, you weren't listening.
Baskerville, heard of it?

210
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,840
Vaguely. It's very hush-hush.

211
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,400
Sounds like a good place to start.
You'll come down?

212
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,720
I can't leave London
at the moment, far too busy.

213
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,200
But don't worry,
I'm putting my best man onto it.

214
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:20,480
I can always rely on John
to send me the relevant data, as
he never understands a word of it.

215
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,360
What are you talking about?
You don't have a case! You were
complaining... I've got Bluebell!

216
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:30,800
The case of the vanishing
glow-in-the-dark rabbit. NATO's in
uproar. Oh, you're not coming, then?

217
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,040
Oh.

218
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,160
OK.

219
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,880
OK.

220
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,000
I don't need those any more,
I'm going to Dartmoor.

221
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,960
You go on ahead, Henry, we'll follow
later. Sorry, so you are coming?

222
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,640
20-year-old disappearance,
a monstrous hound?

223
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,840
I wouldn't miss this for the world!

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,480
SHOUTING
..cruise together, you had
no intention of taking me on a boat!

225
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,040
BANG

226
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,480
Oh! Looks like Mrs Hudson
finally got to the wife in Doncaster.

227
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Hm. Wait until she finds out
about the one in Islamabad.

228
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,880
Paddington Station, please.

229
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,640
There's Baskerville.

230
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,240
Er... That's Grimpen Village.

231
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,840
So that must be...

232
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,640
Yes, Dewer's Hollow.

233
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,360
What's that? Hm?

234
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,000
A mine field?

235
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,560
Technically,
Baskerville's an army base,

236
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,560
so I guess they've always been keen
to keep people out.

237
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,800
Clearly.

238
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,520
Right, three tours a day.
Tell your friends, tell anyone.

239
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,880
Don't be strangers. And remember,
stay away from the moor at night,

240
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,240
if you value your lives!
Take care.

241
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,920
THEY LAUGH

242
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,280
It's cold.

243
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,320
HE GROWLS

244
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,960
HE SCREAMS

245
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,920
SCREAMING

246
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,760
HE SIGHS

247
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,360
That part doesn't change.

248
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,560
What does?

249
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,200
Oh, there's something else.
It's a word.

250
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,360
Liberty.

251
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,520
Liberty?

252
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,480
And there's another word.

253
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,640
In.

254
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,040
I. N.

255
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,320
Liberty In.
What do you think it means?

256
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,440
Sorry we couldn't do
a double room for you boys.

257
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,160
That's fine. We're not...

258
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,120
There you go.

259
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,160
Oh, ta. I'll just get your change.
Ta.

260
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,680
There you go.

261
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,080
I couldn't help noticing, on the map
of the moor, a skull and crossbones?

262
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,640
Oh, that.

263
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,880
Pirates? Er, no. The Great Grimpen
Minefield, they call it. Oh, right.

264
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,320
It's not what you think.
It's the Baskerville testing site.

265
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,200
It's been going for 80-odd years.

266
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,320
I'm not sure anyone really knows
what's there any more. Hm.

267
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,200
Explosives? Oh, not just explosives.

268
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,600
Break into that place and if
you're lucky, you just get blown up,
so they say.

269
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,360
In case you're planning
a wee stroll. Ta. I'll remember.

270
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,440
Aye. No, it buggers up tourism
a bit, so thank God
for the demon hound.

271
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,440
Did you see that show? The
documentary? Quite recently, yeah.

272
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,720
God bless Henry Knight
and his monster from hell.

273
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,920
Ever seen it? The hound?
Me? No, no.

274
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,440
Fletcher has.

275
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,000
He runs the walks, the monster walks
for the tourists, you know.
He's seen it.

276
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,840
That's handy for trade.

277
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,520
I'm just saying we've been
rushed off our feet, Billy.
Yeah, lots of monster hunters.

278
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:55,800
It don't take much these days,
one mention on Twitter and whoomph!

279
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,440
We're out of WKD.

280
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,360
Oh, right. What with the monster
and the ruddy prison,

281
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,280
I don't know how we sleep nights.

282
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,840
Do you, Gary? Like a baby.

283
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,920
That's not true. He's a snorer.
Hey, ssh.

284
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,280
Is yours a snorer? Got any crisps?

285
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:16,160
Yeah. No. All right? Right,
take care. Bye. Take care, bye.

286
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,640
Mind if I join you?

287
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,760
It's not true, is it, you haven't
actually seen this hound thing?

288
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,600
Are you from the papers? No,
nothing like that, just curious.

289
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,200
Have you seen it? Maybe.

290
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,120
Got any proof?

291
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,920
Why would I tell you if I did?
Excuse me.

292
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:47,800
I called Henry. Bet's off John,
sorry. What? Bet?

293
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:52,200
My plan needs darkness. We've got
another half an hour of light.
Wait, wait, what bet?

294
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,080
Oh, I bet John here 50 quid that you
couldn't prove you'd seen the hound.

295
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,960
Yeah, the guys in the pub
said you could.

296
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,400
Well, you're going to lose
your money, mate. Yeah?

297
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,160
Yeah. I seen it.

298
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,440
Only about a month ago. Up at
the Hollow. It was foggy, mind,
couldn't make much out.

299
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,360
I see. No witnesses, I suppose.
No, but... Never are.

300
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,400
No, wait. There.

301
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,920
Is that it? It's not exactly proof,
is it? Sorry, John, I win.

302
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,160
Wait, wait, that's not all. People
don't like going up there, you know.

303
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,560
To the Hollow.

304
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,840
Gives them a bad sort of feeling.

305
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:34,120
Ooh, is it haunted?
Is that supposed to convince me?

306
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,720
Nah, don't be stupid!
Nothing like that.

307
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,560
But I reckon
there is something out there.

308
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,400
Something from Baskerville, escaped.

309
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,920
A clone? A super-dog? Maybe.

310
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:48,840
God knows what they've been
spraying on us all these years,
or putting in the water.

311
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,960
I wouldn't trust them
as far as I could spit.

312
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,320
Is that the best you've got?

313
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,520
I had a mate once
who worked for the MOD.

314
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,520
One weekend we were meant to go
fishing, but he never showed up.

315
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,040
Well, not till late.

316
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:06,720
When he did,
he was white as a sheet.

317
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,640
I can see him now.

318
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,480
"I've seen things today,
Fletcher," he said,

319
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,640
"that I never want to see again.

320
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,600
"Terrible things."

321
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,560
He'd been sent to some secret
army place. Porton Down, maybe.

322
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,920
Maybe Baskerville,
or somewhere else.

323
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:31,000
In the labs there,
the really secret labs,

324
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,840
he said he'd seen terrible things.

325
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,480
Rats as big as dogs, he said.

326
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:43,960
And dogs, dogs the size of horses.

327
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,280
Um, we did say 50.

328
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,200
Ta.

329
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,720
Pass, please.

330
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,800
Thank you.

331
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,320
You've got ID for Baskerville?!

332
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,720
How?

333
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,440
It's not specific to this place.
It's my brother's.

334
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,520
Access all areas. I, um, ahem,
acquired it ages ago. Just in case.

335
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,360
Brilliant. What's the matter?
We'll get caught. We won't!

336
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,400
Well, not yet.
Caught in five minutes.

337
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,840
"Hi, we thought we'd have a wander
around your top secret weapons base."

338
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,480
"Really? Great. Come in, kettle's
boiled." That's if we don't get shot.

339
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,640
Clear. Thanks very much. Thank you.

340
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,800
Straight through, sir.
Mycroft's name literally opens doors.

341
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,520
I've told you, he practically is
the British Government.

342
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,440
I reckon we've got about 20 minutes
before they realise
something's wrong.

343
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,640
What is it? Are we in trouble?
Are we in trouble, sir.

344
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,640
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.
You were expecting us?

345
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,240
Your ID showed up straight away,
Mr Holmes. Corporal Lyons, security.

346
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,560
Is there something wrong, sir?
I hope not, Corporal, I hope not.
We don't get inspected here.

347
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,040
Ever heard of a spot check?

348
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,080
Captain John Watson,
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers. Sir.

349
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,360
Major Barrymore won't be pleased,
sir. He'll want to see you both.

350
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,960
I'm afraid we won't have time.
We need the full tour.

351
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,600
Right away. Carry on.
That's an order, Corporal. Yes, sir.

352
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,520
Nice touch.
Haven't pulled rank in ages.

353
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,120
Enjoy it? Oh, yeah.

354
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,280
MONKEY SCREECHES

355
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,600
How many animals do you keep down
here? Lots, sir.

356
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,880
Any ever escape? They'd have to know
how to use that lift, sir.

357
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,920
We're not breeding them that clever.
Unless they have help.

358
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:34,200
Ah, and you are? It's all right,
Dr Frankland,

359
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,800
I'm just showing these gentlemen
around. Ah, new faces, how nice.

360
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,000
Careful you don't get stuck here,
though, I only came to fix a tap.

361
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,520
How far down does that lift go?
Quite a way, sir.

362
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,560
Hm-mm. And what's down there?

363
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:51,400
Well, we have to keep
the bins somewhere, sir.

364
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,800
This way please, gentlemen.

365
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,360
So what exactly is it that you do
here?

366
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,200
I thought you'd know, sir,
this being an inspection.

367
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,880
Well, I'm not an expert, am I?

368
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:10,360
Everything from stem cell research
to trying to cure the common cold,
sir.

369
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,640
But mostly weaponry?
Of one sort or another, yes.

370
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,800
Biological, chemical? One war ends,
another begins, sir.

371
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,960
New enemies to fight.
We have to be prepared.

372
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,040

374
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,400
OK, Michael,
let's try Harlow 3 next time.

375
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,400
Dr Stapleton... Stapleton?

376
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,280
Yes? Who's this?

377
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:41,400
Priority ultra, ma'am, orders from
on high. An inspection. Really?

378
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,720
We are to be accorded
every courtesy, Dr Stapleton.
What's your role at Baskerville?

379
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,840
SHE LAUGHS

380
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,720
Accorded every courtesy,
isn't that the idea?

381
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,960
I'm not free to say.
Official secrets.

382
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,920
Oh, you most certainly are free,
and I suggest you remain that way.

383
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,280
I have a lot of fingers
in a lot of pies.

384
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,320
I like to mix things up.

385
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,960
Genes, mostly.
Now and again, actual fingers.

386
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,400
Stapleton! I knew I knew your name.

387
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,560
I doubt it.

388
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,040
People say there's no such thing
as coincidence.

389
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,600
Dull lives they must lead.

390
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,640
Have you been talking
to my daughter? Why did Bluebell
have to die, Dr Stapleton?

391
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:28,080
The rabbit? Disappeared from inside
a locked hutch, which was always
suggestive. The rabbit?

392
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,920
Clearly an inside job.
Oh, you reckon?

393
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,360
Why? Because it glowed in the dark.

394
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,760
I have absolutely no idea what
you're talking about. Who are you?

395
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,400
ALARM SOUNDS

396
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,920
We've seen enough for now.
Thank you so much. That's it?

397
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,200
That's it. It's this way, isn't it?

398
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,720
Just a minute!

399
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,560
Did we just break into a military
base to investigate a rabbit?

400
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,000
BEEPING

402
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,480
Ha! 23 minutes.
Mycroft's getting slow.

403
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,440
Hello, again.

404
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,840
Er, Major...

405
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,240
This is bloody outrageous!
Why wasn't I told?!

406
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,880
Major Barrymore, is it?
Yes, well, good.

407
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,600
Very good, we're very impressed.
Aren't we, Mr Holmes?

408
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:53,040
Hugely. The point of Baskerville was
to eliminate bureaucratic nonsense!
Sorry, Major. Inspections!

409
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:58,640
Can't remain unmonitored for ever,
goodness knows what you'd get up to.
Keep walking. Sir!

410
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,880
ALARM SOUNDS

411
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,520
ID unauthorised, sir. What?
I've just had the call.

412
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,720
Is that right? Who are you?

413
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,160
Look, there's obviously been
some kind of mistake.

414
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,680
Clearly not, Mycroft Holmes.

415
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:15,120
Computer error.
It'll all have to go in the report.
What the hell's going on?

416
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,080
It's all right, Major,
I know who these gentlemen are.

417
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,840
You do? Yeah,
I'm getting a little slow on faces,

418
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,280
but Mr Holmes here isn't someone
I expected to show up in this place.

419
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:28,400
Oh, well... Good to see you again,
Mycroft.

420
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:34,800
I had the honour of meeting
Mr Holmes at the WHO conference in...
Brussels, was it?

421
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,520
Vienna. Vienna, that's it.

422
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,560
This is Mr Mycroft Holmes, Major.
There's obviously been a mistake.

423
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,960
On your head be it, Dr Frankland.

424
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,720
I'll show them out, Corporal.
Very well, sir.

425
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,400
Thank you.

426
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,360
This is about Henry Knight,
isn't it? I thought so.

427
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,880
I knew he wanted help, but I didn't
realise he was going to contact
Sherlock Holmes!

428
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,720
Oh, don't worry,
I know who you really are.
I'm never off your website.

429
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,360
I thought you'd be wearing the hat.
That wasn't my hat.

430
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,040
I hardly recognise him
without the hat. It wasn't my hat.

431
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:26,240
I love the blog, too, Dr Watson.
Oh, cheers.

432
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,200
The pink thing. And that one about
the aluminium crutch. Yes.

433
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,720
You know Henry Knight?
Well, I knew his dad better.

434
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,480
He had all sorts of mad theories
about this place.

435
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,560
Still, he was a good friend.

436
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,520
Listen, I can't really talk now.

437
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,760
Here's my cell number.

438
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,200
If I can help with Henry,
give me a call.

439
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,360
I never did ask, Dr Frankland,
what exactly is it that you do here?

440
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,320
Ah, Mr Holmes,
I would love to tell you,

441
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,280
but then, of course,
I'd have to kill you.

442
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:02,120
That would be tremendously ambitious
of you. Tell me about Dr Stapleton.

443
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,240
I never speak ill of a colleague.

444
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,640
But you'd speak well of one,
which you're clearly omitting to do.

445
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,840
I do seem to be, don't I?

446
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,440
I'll be in touch. Any time.

447
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,400
So? So?

448
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,440
What was all that about the rabbit?

449
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,280
Oh, please,
can we not do this, this time?

450
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,280
Do what? You being all mysterious
with your...cheekbones,

451
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:30,400
and turning your coat collar up
so you look cool.

452
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,480
I don't do that. Yeah, you do.

453
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:52,120
So, the email from Kirsty.
The missing luminous rabbit.

454
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:56,240
Kirsty Stapleton, whose mother
specialises in genetic manipulation.

455
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,840
She made her daughter's rabbit
glow in the dark?

456
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,280
Probably a fluorescent gene.

457
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,680
Removed and spliced into the
specimen. Simple enough, these days.

458
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,280
So?

459
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:13,800
So we know that Dr Stapleton
performs secret genetic experiments
on animals.

460
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,920
The question is, has she been
working on something deadlier
than a rabbit?

461
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:23,120
To be fair,
that is quite a wide field.

462
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,000
Hi. Hi.

463
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,840
Come in, come in.

464
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,680
This is, er...

465
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,920
Are you, um, rich?

466
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,360
Yeah. Right.

467
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,360
There's a couple of words,
it's what I keep seeing.

468
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,200
Liberty.

469
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:18,360
Liberty? Liberty. And...

470
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,600
In.

471
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,440
It's just that.

472
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,800
Have you finished? Hm.

473
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:34,720
Mean anything to you?
Liberty in death, isn't that the
expression? The only true freedom.

474
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,680
What now, then?

475
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,560
Sherlock's...got a plan? Yes.

476
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,960
Right. We take you back out
onto the moor.

477
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,600
OK... And see if
anything attacks you. What?

478
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,400
That should bring things to a head.
At night?

479
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,240
You want me to go out there
at night? Hm. That's your plan?

480
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,800
Brilliant! Got any better ideas?
That's not a plan.

481
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,960
If there is a monster out there,
John, there's only one thing to do.
Find out where it lives.

(Sherlock?)

488
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,600
Met a friend of yours? What?

489
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,240
Dr Frankland?

490
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,720
Oh, right. Bob, yeah.

491
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,360
He seems pretty concerned about you.

492
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,000
Oh, he's a worrier, bless him.

493
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,160
He's been very kind to me
since I came back.

494
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,320
He knew your father? Yeah.

495
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,080
But he works at Baskerville. Didn't
your dad have a problem with that?

496
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:29,800
Well, mates are mates, aren't
they? I mean, look at you and John.

497
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,600
What about us?

498
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:36,960
Well, I mean, he's a pretty
straightforward bloke and you...

499
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,520
Well, they agreed never to talk
about work, Uncle Bob and my dad.

500
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,000
Dewer's Hollow.

501
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,360
(Sherlock.)

502
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,840
METALLIC THUD

503
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,040
THUDDING CONTINUES

504
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
THUD

505
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,840
THUDDING CONTINUES

506
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,280
SCREECHING

507
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,000
HOWLING IN THE DISTANCE

508
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,320
HOWLING GETS LOUDER

509
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,840
GROWLING

510
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,280
SNARLING

511
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,280
Oh, my god, oh, my god,
oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

512
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,080
Did you see it?

513
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,760
Did you hear that? We saw it.
We saw it!

514
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,520
No, I didn't see anything.

515
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,120
What? What are you talking about?

516
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,480
I didn't see anything.

517
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:07,080
Look, he must have seen it.

518
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:10,680
I saw it. He must have.
He must have.

519
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:14,760
I... Why? Why?
Why would he say that?

520
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,400
It was there, it was.

521
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,640
Henry, Henry, I need you
to sit down. Try and relax, please.

522
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,480
I'm OK, I feel OK.
I'm going to give you something
to help you sleep. All right?

523
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,760
This is good news, John.

524
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:30,560
It's...it's...it's good.

525
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,280
I'm not crazy.

526
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,640
There is a hound there, there is.

527
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:43,360
And Sherlock, he saw it too.
No matter what he says, he saw it.

528
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,960
Well, he's in a pretty bad way.
He's manic.

529
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:02,880
Totally convinced there's some
mutant super-dog roaming the moors.

530
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,760
And there isn't, though, is there?

531
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:07,600
If people knew how to make
a mutant super-dog, we'd know.

532
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,920
It'd be for sale.
I mean, that's how it works.

533
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,280
Listen, on the moor I saw
someone signalling, Morse.

534
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,560
I guess it's Morse.
It doesn't seem to make much sense.

535
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,960
HE BREATHES DEEPLY

536
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:24,840
U, M, Q, R, A,
does that mean anything?

537
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,440
So, OK, what have we got?

538
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,200
We know there's footprints,
because Henry found them,

539
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,640
and so did the tour guide bloke.

540
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,200
We all heard something.

541
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:44,520
Maybe we should just look for
whoever's got a big dog.

542
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,560
Henry's right. What?

543
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,840
I saw it, too.

544
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,040
What? I saw it too, John.

545
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,800
Just...just a minute, you saw what?

546
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,560
A hound. Out there in the Hollow.

547
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,920
A gigantic hound.

548
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,400
Um, look, Sherlock,
we have to be rational about this.

549
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:19,680
OK, now you,
of all people, can't just...

550
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,160
Let's just stick to what we know,
yes? Stick to the facts.

551
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,680
Once you've ruled out
the impossible, whatever remains,
however improbable, must be true.

552
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,440
What does that mean?

553
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,480
Huh.

554
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,240
Look at me,
I'm afraid, John.

555
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,000
Afraid.

556
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,240
Sherlock.

557
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:47,720
I've always been able to
keep myself distant.

558
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:51,520
Divorce myself from feelings.

559
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,200
But look, you see,
body's betraying me.

560
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,040
Interesting, yes, emotions.

561
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,880
The grit on the lens,
the fly in the ointment.

562
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,200
Yeah, all right, Spock,
just...take it easy.

563
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:09,040
You've been pretty wired lately,
you know you have.

564
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,280
I think you've just gone out there
and got yourself a bit worked up.

565
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,800
Worked up?

566
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,120
It was dark and scary.

567
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,240
Me? There's nothing wrong with me.

568
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,880
Hm.

569
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,720
Sherlock...

570
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,240
Sherl... There is nothing wrong
with me! Do you understand!?

571
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:42,920
You want me to prove it, yes?

572
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,560
We're looking for a dog, yes?
A great big dog, that's your
brilliant theory. Cherchez le chien!

573
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,120
Where shall we start?
How about them?

574
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,320
The sentimental widow and her son,
the unemployed fisherman.

575
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,840
The answer's yes. Yes? She's got a
West Highland Terrier called Whisky,
not what we're looking for!

576
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:02,400
For God's sake!
Look at his jumper, hardly worn.
Clearly he's uncomfortable.

577
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,280
Could be the material
or the hideous pattern,
suggests it's a present.

578
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:08,800
He wants into his mother's
good books. Why? Probably money.

579
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:11,480
He's treating her to a meal,
but his own portion is small.

580
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,560
He wants to impress her, but he's
trying to economise on his own food.
Maybe he's not hungry.

581
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:19,960
No, small plate, starter.
He's practically licked it clean.
She's nearly finished her pavlova.

582
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:22,360
If she'd treated him,
he'd have had as much as he wanted.

583
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,600
He's hungry and not well-off, you
can tell by his cuffs and shoes.

584
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:28,280
Only a mother would give him
a Christmas present like that.

585
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,360
It could be an aunt or older
sister, but mother's more likely.

586
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,360
He was a fisherman, the scarring
on his hands is distinctive,
fish hooks.

587
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,800
They're old,
suggesting long-term unemployment.

588
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,080
Not much industry here,
so he's turned to his widowed mother
for help. Widowed?

589
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,800
She's got a man's wedding ring
on a chain around her neck,
clearly her late husband's

590
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:47,160
and too big for her finger.
She's well-dressed,
but her jewellery is cheap.

591
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,600
She could afford better,
but she's kept it, sentimental.

592
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,800
The dog? There are tiny hairs on her
leg but none above the knees,

593
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,280
suggesting it's a small dog,
probably a terrier.

594
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,560
It is a West Highland Terrier called
Whisky. "How do you know that?"

595
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:02,440
She was on the same train as us
and I heard her call its name.
That's listening.

596
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,200
I use my senses, unlike some people,
so you see, I am fine.

597
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:08,040
In fact, I've never been better,
so just leave me alone!

598
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,560
Yeah, OK.

599
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,520
OK.

600
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,120
Why would you listen to me? I'm just
your friend. I don't have friends.

601
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,600
No.

602
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,720
I wonder why.

603
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,240

HE PANTS AND SCREAMS

618
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,000
That's so mean!

619
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:06,120
Um, more wine, doctor? Are you
trying to get me drunk, doctor?

620
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,520
The thought never occurred.

621
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:13,040
Because a while ago I thought
you were chatting me up.
Oh! Where did I go wrong?

622
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,920
When you started asking about
my patients. Well, I am one
of Henry's oldest friends.

623
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,760
Yeah, and he's one of my
patients, so I can't talk about him.

624
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:22,760
Although he has told me
about all his oldest friends.

625
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,400
Which one are you? A new one?

626
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:30,080
OK, what about his father?
He wasn't one of your patients.

627
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,160
Wasn't he some sort of
conspiracy nutter...theorist?

628
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,200
You're only a nutter if
you're wrong. Hm, and was he wrong?

629
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,640
I should think so. But he got
fixated on Baskerville, didn't he?

630
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:41,880
With what they were doing in there.

631
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,320
Couldn't Henry have gone the
same way, started imagining a hound?

632
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,440
Why do you think
I'll talk about this?

633
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:52,040
Because I think you're worried about
him and because I'm a doctor too.

634
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:57,640
And because I have another friend
who might be having the same problem.

SHE SIGHS

636
00:49:05,800 --> 00:49:08,840
Ah, Dr Watson! Hi. Hello.

637
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:12,200
How's the investigation going?
Er, hello.

638
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,600
What, investigation?

639
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,800
Didn't you know? Don't you read
the blog? Sherlock Holmes.

640
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,840
It's... Sherlock who?

641
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:21,040
Private detective. This is his PA.

642
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,120
PA? Well, live-in PA. Perfect!

643
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:25,520
Live-in..?

644
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:28,160
This is Dr Mortimer,
Henry's therapist.

645
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,640
Oh, hello. Bob Frankland.

646
00:49:31,640 --> 00:49:35,360
Listen, tell Sherlock I've been
keeping an eye on Stapleton.

647
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:37,760
Any time he wants a little chat.
All right? Hm.

648
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,360
HE LAUGHS

649
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:43,240
Oh.

650
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,680
Why don't you buy him a drink?
I think he likes you.

652
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:11,040
Morning!
Oh, how are you feeling?

653
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,880
I...

654
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,120
I didn't sleep very well.
Oh, that's a shame.

655
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,800
Shall I make us some coffee?
Oh, look, you've got damp!

656
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:41,840
Listen, last night...

657
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,440
Why did you say
you hadn't seen anything?

658
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:50,640
I mean, I only saw the hound
for a minute, but... Hound?

659
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,520
What? Why do you call it a hound?
Why a hound?

660
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:56,560
Why? What do you mean?
It's odd, isn't it?

661
00:50:56,560 --> 00:50:58,760
It's a strange choice of words,
archaic.

662
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,040
That's why I took the case.
"Mr Holmes, they were the footprints
of a gigantic hound."

663
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,080
Why say "hound"?

664
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,320
I don't know, I've never...

665
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:08,720
Actually, I'd better skip
the coffee.

666
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:13,200
BIRDSONG

667
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:40,440
Did you get anywhere
with that Morse code?

668
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,720
Nah.

669
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:45,880
U, M, Q, R, A, wasn't it? Umqra.

670
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:47,960
Nothing. Umqra...

671
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,960
Look, forget it. I thought
I was onto something, I wasn't.

672
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:52,640
Sure? Yeah.

673
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:55,760
How about Louise Mortimer,
did you get anywhere with her? No.

674
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,680
Too bad.
But did you get any information?

675
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,440
You're being funny now?

676
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,400
Thought it might break the ice,
a bit.

677
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:06,920
Funny doesn't suit you.
Let's stick to ice.

678
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,800
John... It's fine.

679
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:13,000
Wait, something happened to me
last night, something
I've not experienced before.

680
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:17,880
Yes, you said. Fear, Sherlock Holmes
got scared, you said. It was more
than that, John. It was doubt.

681
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,520
I felt doubt.

682
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,840
I've always been able to trust
my senses, the evidence of
my own eyes, until last night.

683
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:28,800
You can't actually believe
that you saw some kind of monster?
No, I can't believe that.

684
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:32,400
But I did see it,
so the question is, how? How?

685
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:35,240
Yes.

686
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:37,120
Yeah, right, good.

687
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:41,080
So you've got something to
go on, then. Good luck with that.

688
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,600
Listen, what I said before, John,
I meant it.

689
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,280
I don't have friends.

690
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,480
I've just got one.

691
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,760
Right.

692
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:00,520
John.

693
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,960
John! You are amazing!
You are fantastic!

694
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,320
Yes, all right,
you don't have to overdo it.

695
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:12,440
You may not be the most luminous of
people, but as a conductor of light,
you are unbeatable. Cheers(!) What?

696
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:17,320
Some people who aren't geniuses
have an ability to stimulate it
in others. You were saying sorry.

697
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,440
Don't spoil it. So what have I done
that's so bloody stimulating?

698
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,120
Yeah?

699
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:26,880
What if it's not a word,
what if it is individual letters?

700
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,720
You think it's an acronym?

701
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,600
Absolutely no idea, but...

702
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:36,040
What the hell are you doing here?!
Oh, nice to see you too(!)

703
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:39,080
I'm on holiday, would you believe?
No, I wouldn't.

704
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,480
Hello, John. Greg.

705
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,720
I heard you were in the area.
What are you up to?

706
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,880
Are you after this Hound of Hell,
like on the telly?

707
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:50,440
I'm waiting for an explanation,
Inspector, why are you here?
I've told you, I'm on holiday.

708
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,000
You're brown as a nut.
You're clearly just back from your
holidays. I fancied another one.

709
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:58,560
Oh, this is Mycroft, isn't it?
Now, look... Of course it is.

710
00:53:58,560 --> 00:54:03,240
One mention of Baskerville
and he sends down my handler
to spy on me, incognito.

711
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:06,520
Is that why you're calling
yourself "Greg"? That's his name.

712
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:09,560
Is it? Yes.
If you'd ever bothered to find out.

713
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:11,000
Look, I'm not your handler.

714
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,600
And I just don't do
what your brother tells me.

715
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,880
Actually, you could be just the man
we want. Why?

716
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,120
Well, I've not been idle, Sherlock.

717
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,000
I think I might have found something.
Here.

718
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,880
I didn't know if it was relevant.

719
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:28,000
Starting to look like it might be.
That is an awful lot of meat
for a vegetarian restaurant.

720
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,160
Excellent.

721
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:34,280
A nice, scary inspector from
Scotland Yard, who can put in a
few calls, might come in very handy.

722
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:35,520
Shop.

723
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:52,800
What's this?

724
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:55,240
Coffee. I made coffee.
You never make coffee.

725
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,280
Don't you want it?
You don't have to keep apologising.

726
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:01,160
Thanks.

727
00:55:07,400 --> 00:55:09,080
Hm, I don't take sugar.

728
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:16,440
These records go back
nearly two months.

729
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,160
That's nice. It's good.

730
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:21,200
Is that when you had the idea,
after the TV show went out?

731
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,080
It's me. It was me.

732
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,320
I'm sorry, Gary. I couldn't help it.

733
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,040
I had a bacon sandwich
at Cal's wedding and one thing
led to another. Nice try.

734
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:36,440
Look, we were just trying to give
things a bit of a boost, you know?

735
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:40,160
Let a great big dog run wild up
on the moor, it was heaven-sent.

736
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,920
It was like us
having our own Loch Ness monster.

737
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:47,000
And where do you keep it? There's
an old mine shaft. It's not too far.

738
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:50,120
He was all right there. Was?

739
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:53,720
We couldn't control
the bloody thing. It was vicious.

740
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,760
And then, a month ago,

741
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:01,960
Billy took him to the vet
and, you know...

742
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,040
He's dead?

743
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:05,480
Put down.

744
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:08,000
Yeah. No choice.

745
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,760
So it's over.

746
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,920
It was just a joke, you know.

747
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:13,440
Yeah, hilarious(!)

748
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:17,080
You've nearly driven
a man out of his mind.

749
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:38,200
You know he's actually pleased
you're here? Secretly pleased.

750
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:39,600
Is he?

751
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,280
That's nice.

752
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,520
I suppose he likes having
all the same faces back together.

753
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:48,240
Appeals to his...his...

754
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,960
Asperger's?

755
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:53,440
So, you believe them about having
the dog destroyed? No reason not to.

756
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:55,600
Well, hopefully
there's no harm done.

757
00:56:55,600 --> 00:57:00,160
I'm not quite sure what I'd charge
them with, anyway. I'll have a word
with the local force.

758
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,320
Right, that's that, then.
Catch you later.

759
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:07,080
I'm enjoying this. It's nice
to get London out of your lungs.

760
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,520
So that was their dog that people
saw out on the moor? Looks like it.

761
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,560
But that wasn't what you saw,
that wasn't just an ordinary dog.

762
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,800
No. It was immense.

763
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,320
It had burning red eyes,
and it was glowing, John,

764
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,440
its whole body was glowing.

765
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:27,200
I've got a theory, but I need to get
back into Baskerville to test it.

766
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:30,200
How? Can't pull off
the ID trick again.

767
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,360
Might not have to.

768
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:36,480
Hello, brother, dear. How ARE you?

769
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,000
Afternoon, sir.
Can you turn the engine off?

770
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:04,960
Thank you.

771
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,600
I need to see Major Barrymore
as soon as we get inside.

772
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,240
Right. Which means you'll have to
start the search for the hound. OK.

773
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,680
In the labs.

774
00:58:12,680 --> 00:58:14,600
Stapleton's first.

775
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,120
It could be dangerous.

776
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:31,960
Oh, you know I'd love to(!)

777
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:35,280
I'd love to give you unlimited
access to this place. Why not?

778
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,000
It's a simple enough request, Major.
I've never heard of anything
so bizarre.

779
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,920
You're to give me 24 hours,
it's what I negotiated,
not a second more.

780
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,240
I may have to comply with this
order, but I don't have to like it.

781
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:51,240
I don't know what the hell
you expect to find here, anyway.
Perhaps the truth. About what?

782
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,520
Oh, I see.

783
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:55,400
The big coat should have told me.

784
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:58,440
You're one of the conspiracy lot,
aren't you?

785
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,400
Well, then, go ahead, seek them out,

786
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:04,040
the monsters, the death rays,
the aliens.

787
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:06,080
Have you got any of those?

788
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,480
Oh, just wondering.

789
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,600
A couple.
Crash landed here in the '60s.

790
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,960
We call them Abbott and Costello.

791
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,040
Good luck, Mr Holmes.

792
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,680
Aargh! Oh, God!

793
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,920

794
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,760

01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:48,640
'Stay calm, stay calm.
Can you see it?

833
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:52,040
'Can you see it?'

834
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,720
(No, I can't.)

835
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,400
GROWLING

836
01:05:59,360 --> 01:06:00,640
I can see it.

837
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:04,480
(I can see it.

838
01:06:05,640 --> 01:06:06,720
(It's here.)

839
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:11,640
Are you all right? John?

840
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,280
Jesus Christ! It was the hound!

841
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,920
Sherlock, it was here, I swear it,
Sherlock, it must, it must...

842
01:06:18,920 --> 01:06:22,080
Did-did you see it? You must have!

843
01:06:22,080 --> 01:06:25,360
It's all right, it's OK now.

844
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:29,080
NO, IT'S NOT! IT'S NOT OK!

845
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:30,600
I saw it, I was wrong!

846
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:33,520
Hm, well, let's not jump
to conclusions. What?

847
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:36,800
What did you see? I told you, I saw
the hound? Huge, red eyes? Yes.

848
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,000
Glowing? Yeah.

849
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:39,440
No. What?

850
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,280
I made up the bit about glowing.

851
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,920
You saw what you expected to see
because I told you.

852
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:46,920
You have been drugged.
We have all been drugged. Drugged?

853
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:50,560
Can you walk?
Of course I can walk. Come on, then.
It's time to lay this ghost.

854
01:06:57,120 --> 01:07:02,320
Oh, back again?
What's on your mind this time?

855
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,720
Murder, Dr Stapleton.

856
01:07:03,720 --> 01:07:06,680
Refined, cold-blooded murder.

857
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,600
Will you tell little Kirsty what
happened to Bluebell, or shall I?

858
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:18,880
OK. What do you want?

859
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,000
Can I borrow your microscope?

860
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:40,440
Are you sure you're OK?
You look very peaky.

861
01:07:40,440 --> 01:07:42,000
No, I'm all right.

862
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:47,960
It was the GFP gene
from a jellyfish,
in case you're interested. What?

863
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,520
In the rabbits. Oh, right, yeah.

864
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,840
Aequorea victoria,
if you really want to know.

865
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,440
Why? Why not?

866
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:59,360
We don't ask questions like that
here. It isn't done.

867
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:03,120
It was a mix-up, anyway.
My daughter ended up
with one of the lab specimens,

868
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,200
so poor Bluebell had to go.

869
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:09,600
Your compassion is overwhelming!
I know.

870
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:11,960
I hate myself sometimes.

871
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:16,160
So, come on, then, you can trust me,
I'm a doctor,

872
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:19,160
what else have you got
hidden away up here?

873
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,320
SHE SIGHS
Listen, if you can imagine it,

874
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:26,720
someone is probably doing it
somewhere. Of course they are.

875
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:30,520
Cloning? Yes, of course.
Dolly the Sheep, remember?

876
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,400
Human cloning? Why not?

877
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,400
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT
And what about animals? Not sheep.

878
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:42,080
Big animals.

879
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,400
Size isn't a problem. Not at all.

880
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:49,480
The only limits are ethics
and the law and both those things
can be very flexible.

881
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:52,640
But not here, not at Baskerville.
It's not there!

882
01:08:52,640 --> 01:08:55,520
Jesus! Nothing there!
It doesn't make any sense!

883
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,200
What were you expecting to find?

884
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:59,240
A drug, of course.
It has to be a drug.

885
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,000
An hallucinogenic
or a deliriant of some kind.

886
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:05,120
There's no trace of anything
in the sugar. Sugar? Sugar, yes.

887
01:09:05,120 --> 01:09:10,200
A simple process of elimination.
I saw the hound, saw it as my
imagination expected me to see it.

888
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:13,240
A genetically engineered monster.

889
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,560
I knew I couldn't believe my eyes,
so there were
seven possible reasons,

890
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,080
the most possible being narcotics.

891
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:23,920
Henry Knight, he saw it too, but
you didn't, John. You didn't see it.

892
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,960
We have eaten and drunk the same
things since we got to Grimpen,
apart from one thing.

893
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:30,280
You don't take sugar in your coffee.
I see, so?

894
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:34,040
I took it from Henry's kitchen,
his sugar.

895
01:09:34,040 --> 01:09:36,120
It's perfectly all right.

896
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:38,400
But maybe it's not a drug.
No, it has to be a drug.

897
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,080
How did it get into our systems?
How?

898
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:49,000
There has to be something,
something...

899
01:09:49,000 --> 01:09:50,800
Something...

900
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:54,640
Something buried deep.

901
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:57,080
Get out. What?

902
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,120
Get out, I need to go to
my mind palace. Your what?

903
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:05,800
He's not going to be doing
much talking for a while,
we may as well go.

904
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:09,400
His what? Oh, his "mind palace".

905
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:12,760
It's a memory technique,
a sort of mental map.

906
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:16,920
You plot a map with a location,
it doesn't have to be a real place.

907
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,560
You deposit memories there.

908
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,360
Theoretically, you never forget
anything. All you do is find your way
back to it.

909
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:25,960
So this imaginary location could be
anything, a house or a street? Yeah.

910
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:29,600
But he said "palace", he said it was
a palace? Yeah, well, he would,
wouldn't he?

911
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,960
BELL TOLLS

912
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,560
SOUND OF MARCHING BAND
FADES IN AND OUT

913
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:13,440
DOG BARKS AND HOWLS

914
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:14,920
# You ain't nothing... #

915
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:20,240
MECHANISED VOICE: Hound.

916
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,960
DOG HOWLS

917
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:38,080
ANIMAL SNARLS

918
01:11:48,080 --> 01:11:49,080
GUNSHOT

919
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,360
SHE SCREAMS AND WHIMPERS

920
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,360
SHE WHIMPERS

921
01:11:57,360 --> 01:11:59,520
Oh, my god!

922
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:05,760
Oh, my god! Oh, my god! I am so...
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

923
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:26,400
John? Yeah, I'm on it.

924
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:30,680
Project HOUND. I must have
read about it, stored it away.

925
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:33,720
An experiment in
a CIA facility in Liberty, Indiana.

926
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,400
SHE TAPS THE KEYBOARD

927
01:12:40,600 --> 01:12:43,040
H-O-U-N-D.

928
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,960
That's as far as my access goes,
I'm afraid.

929
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,000
There must be an override,
a password?

930
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,200
I imagine so,
but that'd be Major Barrymore's.

931
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:58,680
Password, password. Password.

932
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,760
He sat here when he thought it up.

933
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,040
Describe him to me? You've seen him.
But describe him.

934
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:11,920
He's a bloody martinet,
a throw-back,
the sort they'd have sent into Suez.

935
01:13:11,920 --> 01:13:17,000
Good, excellent, old-fashioned.
Traditionalist. Not the sort to use
his children's name as a password.

936
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:20,800
He loves his job, proud of it
and this is work-related.
So what's at eye level?

937
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:22,600
Books.

938
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,520
Jane's Defence Weekly, bound copies.
Hannibal.

939
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:30,360
Wellington. Rommel. Churchill's
History of the English-Speaking
Peoples, all four volumes.

940
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:33,560
Churchill, he's fond of Churchill.

941
01:13:33,560 --> 01:13:37,520
Copy of The Downing Street Years,
one to five.
Separate biographies of Thatcher.

942
01:13:37,520 --> 01:13:40,560
Mid-1980s, at a guess.
Father and son.

943
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,120
Barrymore Senior, medals,
Distinguished Service Order.
That date, I'd say Falklands veteran.

944
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:48,840
Right, Thatcher's a more likely bet
than Churchill. That's the password?

945
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,400
No! With a man like Major Barrymore,
only first name terms would do.

946
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:04,880
MACHINE BEEPS WILDLY

947
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,320
Hound.

948
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,280
Hm.

949
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:45,720
Jesus.

950
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:53,440
Project HOUND. A new deliriant drug
which rendered its users
incredibly suggestible.

951
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:58,160
They wanted to use it
as an anti-personnel weapon,
to totally disorientate the enemy

952
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:02,400
using fear and stimulus.
But they shut it down
and hid it away in 1986.

953
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:06,440
Because of what it did
to the subjects they tested it on.
And what they did to others.

954
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:11,200
Prolonged exposure drove them
insane. Made them almost
uncontrollably aggressive.

955
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,880
So, someone's been doing it again?
Carrying on the experiments?

956
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:18,440
Attempting to refine it, perhaps.
For the last 20 years. Who?

957
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,040
Those names mean anything to you?

958
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:22,880
No, not a thing.

959
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:25,840
(SIGHS) Five principal scientists.

960
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:28,600
20 years ago.

961
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:34,120
Maybe our friend's somewhere
in the back of the picture?

962
01:15:34,120 --> 01:15:37,320
Someone old enough to be there at
the time of the experiments in 1986?

963
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:44,440
Maybe somebody who says "cell phone"
because of time spent in America?
You remember, John? Hm-mm.

964
01:15:44,440 --> 01:15:46,440
Here's my, uh, cell number.

965
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:48,680
He gave us his number,
in case we needed him.

966
01:15:48,680 --> 01:15:50,760
Oh, my god, Bob Frankland.

967
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:54,280
But Bob doesn't work on...
He's a virologist.
This is chemical warfare.

968
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:57,600
That's where he started, though.

969
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:02,920
He's never lost the certainty,
the obsession that that drug
really could work.

970
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:07,360
Nice of him to give us his number.
Let's arrange a little meeting.

971
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:12,240
PHONE RINGS

972
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,400
Hello?

973
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:22,320
WOMAN SOBS ON THE PHONE

974
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:25,040
Who's this? You've got to find Henry.

975
01:16:25,040 --> 01:16:26,960
It's Louise Mortimer.

976
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,360
Louise, what's wrong?

977
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:31,680
Henry was, was remembering. Then...

978
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,640
He tried...

979
01:16:34,640 --> 01:16:38,040
He's got a gun, he went
for the gun and tried to... What?

980
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,080
SHE SOBS

981
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:43,560
He's gone. But you've got to stop
him, I don't know what he might do.

982
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:45,600
Where, where are you?

983
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:47,640
His house. I'm OK. I'm OK.

984
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:50,440
Right, stay there.
We'll get someone to you, OK?

985
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:53,520
Henry? He's attacked her. Gone? Hm.

986
01:16:53,520 --> 01:16:56,160
There's only one place he'll go,
back to where it started.

987
01:16:56,160 --> 01:17:00,000
Lestrade? Get to the Hollow. Dewer's
Hollow, now! And bring a gun.

988
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,840
FERAL SQUEAL ECHOES

989
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:09,440
HE PANTS

990
01:17:41,720 --> 01:17:43,440
I'm sorry.

991
01:17:47,720 --> 01:17:49,760
I'm so sorry, Dad.

992
01:17:54,440 --> 01:17:57,720
No, Henry, no, no! Get back!

993
01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:01,120
Get away from me!
Easy, Henry, easy. Just relax.

994
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:03,680
I know what I am,
I know what I tried to do.

995
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:07,200
Just put the gun down, it's OK.
No, no! I know what I am!

996
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:08,880
Yes, I'm sure you do, Henry.

997
01:18:08,880 --> 01:18:12,040
It's all been explained to you,
hasn't it?

998
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:14,920
Explained very carefully. What?

999
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:17,800
Someone needed to keep you quiet,

1000
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,040
needed to keep you as a child,
to reassert the dream
you both clung on to,

1001
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,960
because you had started to remember.

1002
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:29,800
Remember now, Henry, you've got
to remember what happened here
when you were a little boy.

1003
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:33,640
I thought it had got my dad.

1004
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:36,440
The hound. I thought... Oh, Jesus!

1005
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:39,560
I don't...I don't know any more!
I don't!

1006
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:43,840
No, Henry! Henry, for God's sake!
Henry, remember.
"Liberty In." Two words.

1007
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:48,400
Two words a frightened little boy
saw here 20 years ago. You'd started
to piece things together.

1008
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,040
Remember what happened here
that night.

1009
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,480
It wasn't an animal, was it, Henry?

1010
01:18:53,480 --> 01:18:55,560
Not a monster.

1011
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,440
A man.

1012
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:10,000
ATTACKER GRUNTS LIKE AN ANIMAL

1013
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,240
BOY PANTS IN FEAR

1014
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:21,400
THE MAN PANTS WITH EXERTION

1015
01:19:38,920 --> 01:19:41,520
MUTED SCREAM

1016
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:45,160
You couldn't cope.
You were just a child.

1017
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:48,200
So you rationalised it
into something very different.

1018
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,240
Then you started to remember,
so you had to be stopped.

1019
01:19:51,240 --> 01:19:55,320
Driven out of your mind
so that no-one would believe a word
that you said.

1020
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:56,680
Sherlock!

1021
01:19:56,680 --> 01:19:58,400
It's OK.

1022
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,600
It's OK, mate.

1023
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:04,760
But we saw it, the hound,
last night. We did, we s...

1024
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:07,520
No, but there was a dog, Henry,

1025
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:11,560
leaving footprints,
scaring witnesses, but nothing more
than an ordinary dog.

1026
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:15,320
We both saw it, saw it as our
drugged minds wanted us to see it.

1027
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:18,640
Fear and stimulus,
that's how it works.

1028
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,560
But there never was any monster.

1029
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:26,400
HOWLS AND SNARLS

1030
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,080
Sherlock?

1031
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,680
No! No, no, no, no!
Henry, Henry... Sherlock!

1032
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:34,480
No, no! No, no, no, noooo!

1033
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:35,920
Henry.

1034
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,160
DOG SNARLS AGGRESSIVELY

1035
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,840
Sherlock, are you seeing this?

1036
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:45,520
Right, he is not drugged, Sherlock,
so what's that? Oh, oh, no!
What is it?!

1037
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,200
All right, it's still here.

1038
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:52,360
But it's just a dog, Henry. It's
nothing more than an ordinary dog.

1039
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,440
My god!

1040
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,840
ANIMAL SNARLS FIERCELY

1041
01:20:56,840 --> 01:20:58,600
Oh, Christ!

1042
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:08,200
DOG CONTINUES TO SNARL

1043
01:21:08,200 --> 01:21:10,840
HE BREATHES HEAVILY THROUGH THE MASK

1044
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,320
No. No!

1045
01:21:18,480 --> 01:21:19,920
SNARLING ECHOES

1046
01:21:21,200 --> 01:21:23,840
It's not you, not you!

1047
01:21:23,840 --> 01:21:25,880
Argh... Urgh...

1048
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:30,400
HE BREATHES HEAVILY

1049
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,640
The fog. What? It's the fog,
the drug, it's in the fog!

1050
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:39,680
Aerosol dispersant, that's what it
said in the records. Project HOUND,
it's the fog!

1051
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,520
A chemical minefield.

1052
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:46,000
DOG SNARLS
For God's sake, kill it! Kill it!

1053
01:21:46,000 --> 01:21:48,640
LOUD GUNSHOTS

1054
01:21:49,960 --> 01:21:52,680
ANIMAL SQUEALS IN PAIN,
THEN FALLS SILENT

1055
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,000
Look at it, Henry.

1056
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,160
No, no, no. Come on, look at it!

1057
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,600
You bastard.

1058
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:14,280
You...bastard!

1059
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:18,000
20 years! 20 years of my life,
making no sense! It's all over now,
come on.

1060
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:19,960
Why didn't you just kill me?

1061
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:23,560
Because dead men get listened to,
he needed to do more than kill you.

1062
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:27,040
He had to discredit every word
you ever said about your father.

1063
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:29,480
And he had the means
right at his feet.

1064
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:33,360
A chemical minefield,
pressure pads in the ground,

1065
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,800
dosing you up every time
that you came back here.

1066
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:38,360
Murder weapon
and scene of the crime all at once.

1067
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:42,400
Ha ha, oh, this case, Henry.
Thank you.

1068
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:45,440
It's been brilliant! Sherlock. What?

1069
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:47,920
Timing.

1070
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,640
Not good? No, no, it's OK.

1071
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:56,520
It's fine. Because this means...

1072
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,320
this means that my dad was right.

1073
01:23:00,320 --> 01:23:02,800
He'd found something out, hadn't he?

1074
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,080
And that's why you killed him,
because he was right,

1075
01:23:07,080 --> 01:23:13,160
and he'd found you right
in the middle of an experiment!

1076
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,920
SOUND OF DOG SNARLING AND GROWLING

1077
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:18,040
GUNSHOTS

1078
01:23:20,760 --> 01:23:22,720
Frankland!

1079
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:26,720
Frankland! Keep running.

1080
01:23:30,600 --> 01:23:33,040
Come on, keep up!

1081
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:35,080
It's no use, Frankland.

1082
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,640
WARNING ALARM BEEPS

1083
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,880
HIS BREATHING SLOWS

1084
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,920
HE SIGHS

1085
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,680
Thanks, Bill.

1086
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:45,160
So they didn't have it put down
then, the dog? Obviously.

1087
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:48,200
I suppose they just couldn't
bring themselves to do it.

1088
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,440
I see.

1089
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:52,040
No, you don't.

1090
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,920
No, I don't. Sentiment? Sentiment.

1091
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,360
Listen, what happened to me
in the lab?

1092
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,800
Do you want some sauce with that?

1093
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:08,120
I hadn't been to the Hollow.
How come I heard those things there?
Fear and stimulus, you said?

1094
01:25:08,120 --> 01:25:11,240
You must have been dosed with it
elsewhere. In the lab, maybe?

1095
01:25:11,240 --> 01:25:14,160
You saw those pipes,
pretty ancient, leaky as a sieve.

1096
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:18,680
And they were carrying the gas,
so... Um, ketchup was it, or brown?
Hang on.

1097
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:22,160
You thought it was in the sugar. You
were convinced it was in the sugar.

1098
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:26,040
I'd better get going,
there's a train leaving
in half an hour, so if you want...

1099
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,840
Oh, God! It was you.

1100
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:31,400
You locked me in that bloody lab.

1101
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:34,960
I had to, it was an experiment.
An experiment?! Ssh.

1102
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:39,960
I was terrified, scared to death!
I thought the drug was in the sugar,
so I put some in your coffee.

1103
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:45,200
Then I arranged everything with
Major Barrymore. Totally scientific,
laboratory conditions, literally.

1104
01:25:46,680 --> 01:25:49,640
SOUND OF GROWLING

1105
01:25:49,640 --> 01:25:54,520
(It's in here with me.) All right,
keep talking, I'll find you.

1106
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,480
Keep talking. (I can't, it'll hear
me.) Tell me what you're seeing.

1107
01:25:58,480 --> 01:26:01,120
HE TAPS A KEY:
SOUND OF GROWLING ECHOES

1108
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:04,400
I don't know, but I can hear it now.

1109
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:09,840
I knew what effect it had had on
a superior mind, so I needed to try
it on an average one.

1110
01:26:09,840 --> 01:26:12,440
You know what I mean.

1111
01:26:12,440 --> 01:26:16,320
But it wasn't in the sugar. No, well,

1112
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:21,040
I wasn't to know you'd already been
exposed to the gas. So you got it
wrong. No. Hmm.

1113
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:25,200
You were wrong. It wasn't in
the sugar, you got it wrong. A bit.

1114
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,440
It won't happen again.

1115
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,200
Any long-term effects?

1116
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:37,160
None at all. You'll be fine once
you've excreted it. We all will.

1117
01:26:38,720 --> 01:26:41,320
I think I might have taken care
of that already.

1118
01:26:46,440 --> 01:26:49,040
Where are you going?
I won't be a minute.

1119
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,600
Got to see a man about a dog.

1120
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:12,400
All right, let him go.

1121
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:44,720
